    <h2>
      CHAPTER ONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Valentine Corliss walked up Corliss Street the hottest afternoon of that
      hot August, a year ago, wearing a suit of white serge which attracted a
      little attention from those observers who were able to observe anything
      except the heat. The coat was shaped delicately; it outlined the wearer,
      and, fitting him as women&rsquo;s clothes fit women, suggested an
      effeminacy not an attribute of the tall Corliss. The effeminacy belonged
      all to the tailor, an artist plying far from Corliss Street, for the coat
      would have encountered a hundred of its fellows at Trouville or Ostende
      this very day. Corliss Street is the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne, the Park
      Lane, the Fifth Avenue, of Capitol City, that smoky illuminant of our
      great central levels, but although it esteems itself an established
      cosmopolitan thoroughfare, it is still provincial enough to be watchful;
      and even in its torrid languor took some note of the alien garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Corliss, treading for the first time in seventeen years the pavements
      of this namesake of his grandfather, mildly repaid its interest in
      himself. The street, once the most peaceful in the world, he thought, had
      changed. It was still long and straight, still shaded by trees so noble
      that they were betrothed, here and there, high over the wide white
      roadway, the shimmering tunnels thus contrived shot with gold and blue;
      but its pristine complete restfulness was departed: gasoline had arrived,
      and a pedestrian, even this August day of heat, must glance two ways
      before crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Architectural transformations, as vital, staggered the returned native. In
      his boyhood that posthumously libelled sovereign lady, Anne, had terribly
      prevailed among the dwellings on this highway; now, however, there was
      little left of the jig-saw&rsquo;s hare-brained ministrations; but the
      growing pains of the adolescent city had wrought some madness here. There
      had been a revolution which was a riot; and, plainly incited by a new
      outbreak of the colonies, the Goth, the Tudor, and the Tuscan had harried
      the upper reaches to a turmoil attaining its climax in a howl or two from
      the Spanish Moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was a pleasant street in spite of its improvements; in spite, too,
      of a long, gray smoke-plume crossing the summer sky and dropping an
      occasional atomy of coal upon Mr. Corliss&rsquo;s white coat. The green
      continuous masses of tree-foliage, lawn, and shrubbery were splendidly
      asserted; there was a faint wholesome odour from the fine block pavement
      of the roadway, white, save where the snailish water-wagon laid its long
      strips of steaming brown. Locusts, serenaders of the heat, invisible among
      the branches, rasped their interminable cadences, competing bitterly with
      the monotonous chattering of lawn-mowers propelled by glistening black men
      over the level swards beneath. And though porch and terrace were left to
      vacant wicker chairs and swinging-seats, and to flowers and plants in jars
      and green boxes, and the people sat unseen&mdash;and, it might be guessed,
      unclad for exhibition, in the dimmer recesses of their houses&mdash;nevertheless,
      a summery girl under an alluring parasol now and then prettily trod the
      sidewalks, and did not altogether suppress an ample consciousness of the
      white pedestrian&rsquo;s stalwart grace; nor was his quick glance too
      distressingly modest to be aware of these faint but attractive
      perturbations.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few of the oldest houses remained as he remembered them, and there were
      two or three relics of mansard and cupola days; but the herd of cast-iron
      deer that once guarded these lawns, standing sentinel to all true gentry:
      Whither were they fled? In his boyhood, one specimen betokened a family of
      position and affluence; two, one on each side of the front walk, spoke of
      a noble opulence; two and a fountain were overwhelming. He wondered in
      what obscure thickets that once proud herd now grazed; and then he smiled,
      as through a leafy opening of shrubbery he caught a glimpse of a last
      survivor, still loyally alert, the haughty head thrown back in everlasting
      challenge and one foreleg lifted, standing in a vast and shadowy backyard
      with a clothesline fastened to its antlers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Corliss remembered that backyard very well: it was an old battlefield
      whereon he had conquered; and he wondered if &ldquo;the Lindley boys&rdquo;
      still lived there, and if Richard Lindley would hate him now as implacably
      as then.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred yards farther on, he paused before a house more familiar to him
      than any other, and gave it a moment&rsquo;s whimsical attention, without
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a shabby old brick structure, and it stood among the gayest, the
      most flamboyant dwellings of all Corliss Street like a bewildered tramp
      surrounded by carnival maskers. It held place full in the course of the
      fury for demolition and rebuilding, but remained unaltered&mdash;even
      unrepaired, one might have thought&mdash;since the early seventies, when
      it was built. There was a sagging cornice, and the nauseous brown which
      the walls had years ago been painted was sooted to a repellent dinge, so
      cracked and peeled that the haggard red bricks were exposed, like a beggar
      through the holes in his coat. It was one of those houses which are large
      without being commodious; its very tall, very narrow windows, with their
      attenuated, rusty inside shutters, boasting to the passerby of high
      ceilings but betraying the miserly floor spaces. At each side of the front
      door was a high and cramped bay-window, one of them insanely culminating
      in a little six-sided tower of slate, and both of them girdled above the
      basement windows by a narrow porch, which ran across the front of the
      house and gave access to the shallow vestibule. However, a pleasant
      circumstance modified the gloom of this edifice and assured it a remnant
      of reserve and dignity in its ill-considered old age: it stood back a fine
      hundred feet from the highway, and was shielded in part by a friendly
      group of maple trees and one glorious elm, hoary, robust, and majestic, a
      veteran of the days when this was forest ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Corliss concluded his momentary pause by walking up the broken cement
      path, which was hard beset by plantain-weed and the long grass of the
      ill-kept lawn. Ascending the steps, he was assailed by an odour as of
      vehement bananas, a diffusion from some painful little chairs standing in
      the long, high, dim, rather sorrowful hall disclosed beyond the open
      double doors. They were stiff little chairs of an inconsequent, mongrel
      pattern; armless, with perforated wooden seats; legs tortured by the lathe
      to a semblance of buttons strung on a rod; and they had that day received
      a streaky coat of a gilding preparation which exhaled the olfactory
      vehemence mentioned. Their present station was temporary, their purpose,
      as obviously, to dry; and they were doing some incidental gilding on their
      own account, leaving blots and splashes and sporadic little round
      footprints on the hardwood floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old-fashioned brass bell-handle upon the caller&rsquo;s right drooped
      from its socket in a dead fag, but after comprehensive manipulation on the
      part of the young man, and equal complaint on its own, it was constrained
      to permit a dim tinkle remotely. Somewhere in the interior a woman&rsquo;s
      voice, not young, sang a repeated fragment of &ldquo;Lead, Kindly Light,&rdquo;
      to the accompaniment of a flapping dust-cloth, sounds which ceased upon a
      second successful encounter with the bell. Ensued a silence, probably to
      be interpreted as a period of whispered consultation out of range; a
      younger voice called softly and urgently, &ldquo;Laura!&rdquo; and a
      dark-eyed, dark-haired girl of something over twenty made her appearance
      to Mr. Corliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of her he instantly restored a thin gold card-case to the pocket
      whence he was in the act of removing it. She looked at him with only
      grave, impersonal inquiry; no appreciative invoice of him was to be
      detected in her quiet eyes, which may have surprised him, possibly the
      more because he was aware there was plenty of appreciation in his own
      kindling glance. She was very white and black, this lady. Tall, trim,
      clear, she looked cool in spite of the black winter skirt she wore, an
      effect helped somewhat, perhaps, by the crisp freshness of her white
      waist, with its masculine collar and slim black tie, and undoubtedly by
      the even and lustreless light ivory of her skin, against which the strong
      black eyebrows and undulated black hair were lined with attractive
      precision; but, most of all, that coolness was the emanation of her
      undisturbed and tranquil eyes. They were not phlegmatic: a continuing
      spark glowed far within them, not ardently, but steadily and inscrutably,
      like the fixed stars in winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Valentine Corliss, of Paris and Naples, removed his white-ribboned
      straw hat and bowed as no one had ever bowed in that doorway. This most
      vivid salutation&mdash;accomplished by adding something to a rather quick
      inclination of the body from the hips, with the back and neck held
      straight expressed deference without affecting or inviting cordiality. It
      was an elaborate little formality of a kind fancifully called &ldquo;foreign,&rdquo;
      and evidently habitual to the performer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It produced no outward effect upon the recipient. Such self-control is
      unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Madison at home? My name is Valentine Corliss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is at home.&rdquo; She indicated an open doorway upon her right.
      &ldquo;Will you wait in there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mr. Corliss, passing within. &ldquo;I shall
      be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He left the sentence unfinished, for he was
      already alone, and at liberty to reflect upon the extraordinary coolness
      of this cool young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room, with its closed blinds, was soothingly dark after the riotous
      sun without, a grateful obscurity which was one of two attractions
      discovered in it by Mr. Corliss while he waited. It was a depressing
      little chamber, disproportionately high, uncheered by seven chairs (each
      of a different family, but all belonging to the same knobby species, and
      all upholstered a repellent blue), a scratched &ldquo;inlaid table,&rdquo;
      likewise knobby, and a dangerous looking small sofa&mdash;turbulent
      furniture, warmly harmonious, however, in a common challenge to the
      visitor to take comfort in any of it. A once-gilt gas chandelier hung from
      the distant ceiling, with three globes of frosted glass, but undeniable
      evidence that five were intended; and two of the three had been severely
      bitten. There was a hostile little coal-grate, making a mouth under a
      mantel of imitation black marble, behind an old blue-satin fire-screen
      upon which red cat-tails and an owl over a pond had been roughly
      embroidered in high relief, this owl motive being the inspiration of
      innumerable other owls reflected in innumerable other ponds in the
      formerly silver moonlight with which the walls were papered. Corliss
      thought he remembered that in his boyhood, when it was known as &ldquo;the
      parlour&rdquo; (though he guessed that the Madison family called it
      &ldquo;the reception room,&rdquo; now) this was the place where his aunt
      received callers who, she justifiably hoped, would not linger. Altogether,
      it struck him that it might be a good test-room for an alienist: no
      incipient lunacy would remain incipient here.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one incongruity which surprised him&mdash;a wicker waste-paper
      basket, so nonsensically out of place in this arid cell, where not the
      wildest hare-brain could picture any one coming to read or write, that he
      bestowed upon it a particular, frowning attention, and so discovered the
      second attractive possession of the room. A fresh and lovely pink rose,
      just opening full from the bud, lay in the bottom of the basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rustling somewhere in the house and a murmur, above which a
      boy&rsquo;s voice became audible in emphatic but undistinguishable
      complaint. A whispering followed, and a woman exclaimed protestingly,
      &ldquo;Cora!&rdquo; And then a startlingly pretty girl came carelessly
      into the room through the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was humming &ldquo;Quand I&rsquo; Amour Meurt&rdquo; in a gay
      preoccupation, and evidently sought something upon the table in the centre
      of the room, for she continued her progress toward it several steps before
      realizing the presence of a visitor. She was a year or so younger than the
      girl who had admitted him, fairer and obviously more plastic, more
      expressive, more perishable, a great deal more insistently feminine;
      though it was to be seen that they were sisters. This one had eyes almost
      as dark as the other&rsquo;s, but these were not cool; they were sweet,
      unrestful, and seeking; brilliant with a vivacious hunger: and not Diana
      but huntresses more ardent have such eyes. Her hair was much lighter than
      her sister&rsquo;s; it was the colour of dry corn-silk in the sun; and she
      was the shorter by a head, rounder everywhere and not so slender; but no
      dumpling: she was exquisitely made. There was a softness about her:
      something of velvet, nothing of mush. She diffused with her entrance a
      radiance of gayety and of gentleness; sunlight ran with her. She seemed
      the incarnation of a caressing smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was point-device. Her close, white skirt hung from a plainly
      embroidered white waist to a silken instep; and from the crown of her
      charming head to the tall heels of her graceful white suede slippers,
      heels of a sweeter curve than the waist of a violin, she was as modern and
      lovely as this dingy old house was belated and hideous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Valentine Corliss spared the fraction of a second for another glance
      at the rose in the waste-basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl saw him before she reached the table, gave a little gasp of
      surprise, and halted with one hand carried prettily to her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said impulsively; &ldquo;I <i>beg</i> your pardon. I
      didn&rsquo;t know there was&mdash;&mdash; I was looking for a book I
      thought I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, whelmed with a breath-taking shyness, her eyes, after one
      quick but condensed encounter with those of Mr. Corliss, falling beneath
      exquisite lashes. Her voice was one to stir all men: it needs not many
      words for a supremely beautiful &ldquo;speaking-voice&rdquo; to be
      recognized for what it is; and this girl&rsquo;s was like herself,
      hauntingly lovely. The intelligent young man immediately realized that no
      one who heard it could ever forget it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she faltered, turning to leave the room; &ldquo;it
      isn&rsquo;t here&mdash;the book.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else of yours here,&rdquo; said Corliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there?&rdquo; She paused, hesitating at the door, looking at him
      over her shoulder uncertainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dropped this rose.&rdquo; He lifted the rose from the
      waste-basket and repeated the bow he had made at the front door. This time
      it was not altogether wasted.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You lost it. It belongs to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it does. How curious!&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;How
      curious it happened to be <i>there</i>!&rdquo; She stepped to take it from
      him, her eyes upon his in charming astonishment. &ldquo;And how odd that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      She stopped; then said quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know it was <i>my</i> rose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one would know!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her expression of surprise was instantaneously merged in a flash of honest
      pleasure and admiration, such as only an artist may feel in the presence
      of a little masterpiece by a fellow-craftsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily, anticlimax was spared them by the arrival of the person for whom
      the visitor had asked at the door, and the young man retained the rose in
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Madison, a shapeless hillock with a large, harassed, red face,
      evidently suffered from the heat: his gray hair was rumpled back from a
      damp forehead; the sleeves of his black alpaca coat were pulled up to the
      elbow above his uncuffed white shirtsleeves; and he carried in one mottled
      hand the ruins of a palm-leaf fan, in the other a balled wet handkerchief
      which released an aroma of camphor upon the banana-burdened air. He bore
      evidences of inadequate adjustment after a disturbed siesta, but,
      exercising a mechanical cordiality, preceded himself into the room by a
      genial half-cough and a hearty, &ldquo;Well-well-well,&rdquo; as if
      wishing to indicate a spirit of polite, even excited, hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected you might be turning up, after your letter,&rdquo; he
      said, shaking hands. &ldquo;Well, well, well! I remember you as a boy.
      Wouldn&rsquo;t have known you, of course; but I expect you&rsquo;ll find
      the town about as much changed as you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a father&rsquo;s blindness to all that is really vital, he concluded
      his greeting inconsequently: &ldquo;Oh, this is my little girl Cora.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run along, little girl,&rdquo; said the fat father.
    </p>
    <p>
      His little girl&rsquo;s radiant glance at the alert visitor imparted her
      thorough comprehension of all the old man&rsquo;s absurdities, which had
      reached their climax in her dismissal. Her parting look, falling from
      Corliss&rsquo;s face to the waste-basket at his feet, just touched the
      rose in his hand as she passed through the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cora paused in the hall at a point about twenty feet from the door, a
      girlish stratagem frequently of surprising advantage to the practitioner;
      but the two men had begun to speak of the weather. Suffering a momentary
      disappointment, she went on, stepping silently, and passed through a door
      at the end of the hall into a large and barren looking dining-room,
      stiffly and skimpily furnished, but well-lighted, owing to the fact that
      one end of it had been transformed into a narrow &ldquo;conservatory,&rdquo;
      a glass alcove now tenanted by two dried palms and a number of vacant jars
      and earthen crocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here her sister sat by an open window, repairing masculine underwear; and
      a handsome, shabby, dirty boy of about thirteen sprawled on the floor of
      the &ldquo;conservatory&rdquo; unloosing upon its innocent, cracked, old
      black and white tiles a ghastly family of snakes, owls, and visaged
      crescent moons, in orange, green, and other loathsome chalks. As Cora
      entered from the hall, a woman of fifty came in at a door opposite, and, a
      dust-cloth retained under her left arm, an unsheathed weapon ready for
      emergency, leaned sociably against the door-casing and continued to polish
      a tablespoon with a bit of powdered chamois-skin. She was tall and
      slightly bent; and, like the flat, old, silver spoon in her hand, seemed
      to have been worn thin by use; yet it was plain that the three young
      people in the room &ldquo;got their looks&rdquo; from her. Her eyes, if
      tired, were tolerant and fond; and her voice held its youth and something
      of the music of Cora&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he like?&rdquo; She addressed the daughter by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask Coralie?&rdquo; suggested the sprawling
      artist, relaxing his hideous labour. He pronounced his sister&rsquo;s name
      with intense bitterness. He called it &ldquo;Cora-<i>lee</i>,&rdquo; with
      an implication far from subtle that his sister had at some time thus
      Gallicized herself, presumably for masculine favour; and he was pleased to
      receive tribute to his satire in a flash of dislike from her lovely eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask Laura because it was Laura who went to the door,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Madison answered. &ldquo;I do not ask Cora because Cora hasn&rsquo;t seen
      him. Do I satisfy you, Hedrick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`Cora hasn&rsquo;t seen him!&rsquo;&rdquo; the boy hooted
      mockingly. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t? She was peeking out of the library
      shutters when he came up the front walk, and she wouldn&rsquo;t let me go
      to the door; she told Laura to go, but first she took the library
      waste-basket and laid one o&rsquo; them roses&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Those</i> roses,&rdquo; said Cora sharply. &ldquo;He <i>will</i>
      hang around the neighbours&rsquo; stables. I think you ought to do
      something about it, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Them</i> roses!&rdquo; repeated Hedrick fiercely. &ldquo;One o&rsquo;
      them roses Dick Lindley sent her this morning. Laid it in the waste-basket
      and sneaked it into the reception room for an excuse to go galloping in
      and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`Galloping&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Mrs. Madison gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a pretty bum excuse,&rdquo; continued the unaffected youth,
      &ldquo;but you bet your life you&rsquo;ll never beat our Cora-<i>lee</i>
      when there&rsquo;s a person in pants on the premises! It&rsquo;s
      sickening.&rdquo; He rose, and performed something like a toe-dance, a
      supposed imitation of his sister&rsquo;s mincing approach to the visitor.
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, I am such a little sweety! Here I am all alone just
      reeking with Browning-and-Tennyson and thinking to myself about such
      lovely things, and walking around looking for my nice, pretty rose. Where
      can it be? Oh heavens, Mister, are <i>you</i> here? Oh my, I never, never
      thought that there was a <i>man</i> here! How you frighten me! See what a
      shy little thing I am? You <i>do see, don&rsquo;t</i> you, old sweeticums?
      Ta, ta, here&rsquo;s papa. Remember me by that rose, &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s
      just like me. Me and it&rsquo;s twins, you see, cutie-sugar!&rdquo; The
      diabolical boy then concluded with a reversion to the severity of his own
      manner: &ldquo;If she was <i>my</i> daughter I&rsquo;d whip her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His indignation was left in the air, for the three ladies had
      instinctively united against him, treacherously including his private feud
      in the sex-war of the ages: Cora jumped lightly upon the table and sat
      whistling and polishing the nails of one hand upon the palm of another;
      Laura continued to sew without looking up, and Mrs. Madison, conquering a
      tendency to laugh, preserved a serene countenance and said ruminatively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were all rather queer, the Corlisses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick stared incredulously, baffled; but men must expect these things,
      and this was no doubt a helpful item in his education.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if he wants to sell the house,&rdquo; said Mrs. Madison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he would. Anything that would make father get out of it!&rdquo;
      Cora exclaimed. &ldquo;I hope Mr. Corliss will burn it if he doesn&rsquo;t
      sell it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might want to live here himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&rdquo; Cora emitted a derisive outcry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother gave her a quick, odd look, in which there was a real alarm.
      &ldquo;What is he like, Cora?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully foreign and distinguished!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought Hedrick to confront her with a leap as of some wild animal
      under a lash. He landed close to her; his face awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Princely, I should call him,&rdquo; said Cora, her enthusiasm
      undaunted. &ldquo;Distinctly princely!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Princely,&rdquo; moaned Hedrick. &ldquo;Pe-rin-sley!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hedrick!&rdquo; Mrs. Madison reproved him automatically. &ldquo;In
      what way is he `foreign,&rsquo; Cora?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, every way.&rdquo; Cora let her glance rest dreamily upon the
      goaded boy. &ldquo;He has a splendid head set upon a magnificent torso&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Torso</i>!&rdquo; Hedrick whispered hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tall, a glorious figure&mdash;like a young guardsman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      Madness was gathering in her brother&rsquo;s eyes; and observing it with
      quiet pleasure, she added: &ldquo;One sees immediately he has the grand
      manner, the bel air.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick exploded. &ldquo;`<i>Bel air</i>&rsquo;!&rdquo; he screamed, and
      began to jump up and down, tossing his arms frantically, and gasping with
      emotion. &ldquo;Oh, bel air! Oh, blah! `Henry Esmond!&rsquo; Been readin&rsquo;
      `Henry Esmond!&rsquo; Oh, you be-yoo-tiful Cora-Beatrix-a-<i>lee</i>!
      Magganifisent torso! Gull<i>o</i>-rious figgi-your! Bel air! Oh, slush!
      Oh, luv-a-ly slush!&rdquo; He cast himself convulsively upon the floor,
      full length. &ldquo;Luv-a-ly, <i>luv</i>-a-ly slush!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is thirty, I should say,&rdquo; continued Cora, thoughtfully.
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;about thirty. A strong, keen face, rather tanned. He&rsquo;s
      between fair and dark&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick raised himself to the attitude of the &ldquo;Dying Gaul.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;And with `hair slightly silvered at the temples!&rsquo; <i>Ain</i>&rsquo;t
      his hair slightly silvered at the temples?&rdquo; he cried imploringly.
      &ldquo;Oh, sister, in pity&rsquo;s name let his hair be slightly silvered
      at the temples? Only three grains of corn, your Grace; my children are
      starving!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He collapsed again, laid his face upon his extended arms, and writhed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has rather wonderful eyes,&rdquo; said Cora. &ldquo;They seem to
      look right through you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slush, slush, luv-a-ly slush,&rdquo; came in muffled tones from the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he wears his clothes so well&mdash;so differently! You feel at
      once that he&rsquo;s not a person, but a personage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick sat up, his eyes closed, his features contorted as with agony, and
      chanted, impromptu:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Slush, slush, luv-a-ly, slush!
    Le&rsquo;ss all go a-swimmin&rsquo; in a dollar&rsquo;s worth o&rsquo; mush.
    Slush in the morning, slush at night,
    If I don&rsquo;t get my slush I&rsquo;m bound to get tight!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hedrick!&rdquo; said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Altogether I should say that Mr. Valentine Corliss looks as if he
      lived up to his name,&rdquo; Cora went on tranquilly. &ldquo;Valentine
      Corliss of Corliss Street&mdash;I think I rather like the sound of that
      name.&rdquo; She let her beautiful voice linger upon it, caressingly.
      &ldquo;Valentine Corliss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick opened his eyes, allowed his countenance to resume its ordinary
      proportions, and spoke another name slowly and with honeyed
      thoughtfulness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ray Vilas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the shot that told. Cora sprang down from the table with an
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick, subduing elation, added gently, in a mournful whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Poor</i> old Dick Lindley!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His efforts to sting his sister were completely successful at last: Cora
      was visibly agitated, and appealed hotly to her mother. &ldquo;Am I to
      bear this kind of thing all my life? Aren&rsquo;t you <i>ever</i> going to
      punish his insolence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hedrick, Hedrick!&rdquo; said Mrs. Madison sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora turned to the girl by the window with a pathetic gesture. &ldquo;Laura&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      she said, and hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura Madison looked up into her sister&rsquo;s troubled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel so morbid,&rdquo; said Cora, flushing a little and glancing
      away. &ldquo;I wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silent Laura set aside her work, rose and went out of the room. Her
      cheeks, too, had reddened faintly, a circumstance sharply noted by the
      terrible boy. He sat where he was, asprawl, propped by his arms behind
      him, watching with acute concentration the injured departure of Cora,
      following her sister. At the door, Cora, without pausing, threw him a look
      over her shoulder: a full-eyed shot of frankest hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later, magnificent chords sounded through the house. The
      piano was old, but tuned to the middle of the note, and the keys were
      swept by a master hand. The wires were not hammered; they were touched
      knowingly as by the player&rsquo;s own fingers, and so they sang&mdash;and
      from out among the chords there stole an errant melody. This was not
      &ldquo;piano-playing&rdquo; and not a pianist&rsquo;s triumphant
      nimbleness&mdash;it was music. Art is the language of a heart that knows
      how to speak, and a heart that knew how was speaking here. What it told
      was something immeasurably wistful, something that might have welled up in
      the breast of a young girl standing at twilight in an April orchard. It
      was the inexpressible made into sound, an improvisation by a master
      player.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear what she&rsquo;s up to?&rdquo; said Hedrick, turning his
      head at last. But his mother had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He again extended himself flat upon the floor, face downward, this time as
      a necessary preliminary to rising after a manner of his own invention.
      Mysteriously he became higher in the middle, his body slowly forming first
      a round and then a pointed arch, with forehead, knees, and elbows touching
      the floor. A brilliantly executed manoeuvre closed his Gothic period, set
      him upright and upon his feet; then, without ostentation, he proceeded to
      the kitchen, where he found his mother polishing a sugar-bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      He challenged her with a damnatory gesture in the direction of the music.
      &ldquo;You hear what Cora&rsquo;s up to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Madison&rsquo;s expression was disturbed; she gave her son a look
      almost of appeal, and said, gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe there&rsquo;s nothing precisely criminal in her getting
      Laura to play for her. Laura&rsquo;s playing always soothes her when she
      feels out of sorts&mdash;and&mdash;you weren&rsquo;t very considerate of
      her, Hedrick. You upset her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mentioning Ray Vilas, you mean?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She deserves it. Look at her! <i>You</i> know why she&rsquo;s got
      Laura at the piano now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s because you worried her,&rdquo; his
      mother faltered evasively. &ldquo;Besides, it is very hot, and Cora isn&rsquo;t
      as strong as she looks. She said she felt morbid and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morbid? Blah!&rdquo; interrupted the direct boy. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      started after this Corliss man just like she did for Vilas. If I was Dick
      Lindley I wouldn&rsquo;t stand for Cora&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hedrick!&rdquo; His mother checked his outburst pleadingly. &ldquo;Cora
      has so much harder time than the other girls; they&rsquo;re all so much
      better off. They seem to get everything they want, just by asking: nice
      clothes and jewellery&mdash;and automobiles. That seems to make a great
      difference nowadays; they all seem to have automobiles. We&rsquo;re so
      dreadfully poor, and Cora has to struggle so for what good times she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her?&rdquo; the boy jibed bitterly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see her
      doing any particular struggling.&rdquo; He waved his hand in a wide
      gesture. &ldquo;She takes it <i>all</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there!&rdquo; the mother said, and, as if feeling the need
      of placating this harsh judge, continued gently: &ldquo;Cora isn&rsquo;t
      strong, Hedrick, and she does have a hard time. Almost every one of the
      other girls in her set is at the seashore or somewhere having a gay
      summer. You don&rsquo;t realize, but it&rsquo;s mortifying to have to be
      the only one to stay at home, with everybody knowing it&rsquo;s because
      your father can&rsquo;t afford to send her. And this house is so hopeless,&rdquo;
      Mrs. Madison went on, extending her plea hopefully; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      impossible to make it attractive, but Cora keeps trying and trying: she
      was all morning on her knees gilding those chairs for the music-room, poor
      child, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`Music-room&rsquo;!&rdquo; sneered the boy. &ldquo;Gilt chairs! All
      show-off! That&rsquo;s all she ever thinks about. It&rsquo;s all there is
      to Cora, just show-off, so she&rsquo;ll get a string o&rsquo; fellows
      chasin&rsquo; after her. She&rsquo;s started for this Corliss just exactly
      the way she did for Ray Vilas!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hedrick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just look at her!&rdquo; he cried vehemently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you know she&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo; to make this Corliss think it&rsquo;s <i>her</i>
      playin&rsquo; the piano right now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she do that with Ray Vilas?&rdquo; he demanded
      quickly. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that exactly what she did the first time he
      ever came here&mdash;got Laura to play and made him think it was <i>her</i>?
      Didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;just in fun.&rdquo; Mrs. Madison&rsquo;s tone lacked
      conviction; she turned, a little confusedly, from the glaring boy and
      fumbled among the silver on the kitchen table. &ldquo;Besides&mdash;she
      told him afterward that it was Laura.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He walked in on her one day when she was battin&rsquo; away at the
      piano herself with her back to the door. Then she pretended it had been a
      joke, and he was so far gone by that time he didn&rsquo;t care. He&rsquo;s
      crazy, anyway,&rdquo; added the youth, casually. &ldquo;Who is this
      Corliss?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He owns this house. His family were early settlers and used to be
      very prominent, but they&rsquo;re all dead except this one. His mother was
      a widow; she went abroad to live and took him with her when he was about
      your age, and I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ever been back since.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he use to live in this house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; an aunt of his did. She left it to him when she died, two years
      ago. Your father was agent for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think this Corliss wants to sell it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been for sale all the time he&rsquo;s owned it. That&rsquo;s
      why we moved here; it made the rent low.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he rich?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They used to have money, but maybe it&rsquo;s all spent. It seemed
      to me he might want to raise money on the house, because I don&rsquo;t see
      any other reason that could bring him back here. He&rsquo;s already
      mortgaged it pretty heavily, your father told me. I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      Mrs. Madison paused abruptly, her eyes widening at a dismaying thought.
      &ldquo;Oh, I do hope your father will know better than to ask him to stay
      to dinner!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick&rsquo;s expression became cryptic. &ldquo;Father won&rsquo;t ask
      him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll bet you a thousand dollars he
      stays!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother followed her son&rsquo;s thought and did not seek to elicit
      verbal explanation of the certainty which justified so large a venture.
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sarah&rsquo;s threatening
      to leave, anyway; and she gets so cross if there&rsquo;s extra cooking on
      wash-days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sarah&rsquo;ll have to get cross,&rdquo; said the boy grimly;
      &ldquo;and <i>I</i>&rsquo;ll have to plug out and go for a quart of brick
      ice-cream and carry it home in all this heat; and Laura and you&rsquo;ll
      have to stand over the stove with Sarah; and father&rsquo;ll have to
      change his shirt; and we&rsquo;ll all have to toil and moil and sweat and
      suffer while Cora-lee sits out on the front porch and talks toodle-do-dums
      to her new duke. And then she&rsquo;ll have <i>you</i> go out and kid him
      along while&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hedrick</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will!&mdash;while she gets herself all dressed and
      powdered up again. After that, she&rsquo;ll do her share of the work: she&rsquo;ll
      strain her poor back carryin&rsquo; Dick Lindley&rsquo;s flowers down the
      back stairs and stickin&rsquo; &rsquo;em in a vase over a hole in the
      tablecloth that Laura hasn&rsquo;t had time to sew up. You wait and see!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gloomy realism of this prophecy was not without effect upon the seer&rsquo;s
      mother. &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she exclaimed, protestingly. &ldquo;We
      really can&rsquo;t manage it. I&rsquo;m sure Cora won&rsquo;t want to ask
      him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m sure she wouldn&rsquo;t think of it, but if she does
      I&rsquo;ll tell her we can&rsquo;t. We really can&rsquo;t, to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son looked pityingly upon her. &ldquo;She ought to be <i>my </i>
      daughter,&rdquo; he said, the sinister implication all too plain;&mdash;&ldquo;just
      about five minutes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, he effectively closed the interview and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to his abandoned art labours in the &ldquo;conservatory,&rdquo;
      and meditatively perpetrated monstrosities upon the tiles for the next
      half-hour, at the end of which he concealed his box of chalks, with an
      anxiety possibly not unwarranted, beneath the sideboard; and made his way
      toward the front door, first glancing, unseen, into the kitchen where his
      mother still pursued the silver. He walked through the hall on tiptoe,
      taking care to step upon the much stained and worn strip of &ldquo;Turkish&rdquo;
      carpet, and not upon the more resonant wooden floor. The music had ceased
      long since.
    </p>
    <p>
      The open doorway was like a brilliantly painted picture hung upon the
      darkness of the hall, though its human centre of interest was no startling
      bit of work, consisting of Mr. Madison pottering aimlessly about the
      sun-flooded, unkempt lawn, fanning himself, and now and then stooping to
      pull up one of the thousands of plantain-weeds that beset the grass. With
      him the little spy had no concern; but from a part of the porch out of
      sight from the hall came Cora&rsquo;s exquisite voice and the light and
      pleasant baritone of the visitor. Hedrick flattened himself in a corner
      just inside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should break any engagement whatsoever if I had one,&rdquo; Mr.
      Corliss was saying with what the eavesdropper considered an offensively
      &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; accent and an equally unjustifiable gallantry;
      &ldquo;but of course I haven&rsquo;t: I am so utterly a stranger here.
      Your mother is immensely hospitable to wish you to ask me, and I&rsquo;ll
      be only too glad to stay. Perhaps after dinner you&rsquo;ll be very, very
      kind and play again? Of course you know how remarkable such&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just improvising,&rdquo; Cora tossed off, carelessly, with a
      deprecatory ripple of laughter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s purely with the mood,
      you see. I can&rsquo;t make myself do things. No; I fancy I shall not play
      again today.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t I fasten that in your buttonhole for you,&rdquo; said
      Cora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see how patiently I&rsquo;ve been awaiting the offer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another little silence; and the listener was able to construct a
      picture (possibly in part from an active memory) of Cora&rsquo;s delicate
      hands uplifted to the gentleman&rsquo;s lapel and Cora&rsquo;s eyes for a
      moment likewise uplifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, one has moods,&rdquo; she said, dreamily. &ldquo;I am <i>all</i>
      moods. I think you are too, Mr. Corliss. You <i>look</i> moody. Aren&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A horrible grin might have been seen to disfigure the shadow in the corner
      just within the doorway.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THREE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was cooler outdoors, after dinner, in the dusk of that evening;
      nevertheless three members of the Madison family denied themselves the
      breeze, and, as by a tacitly recognized and habitual house-rule, so
      disposed themselves as to afford the most agreeable isolation for the
      younger daughter and the guest, who occupied wicker chairs upon the porch.
      The mother and father sat beneath a hot, gas droplight in the small
      &ldquo;library&rdquo;; Mrs. Madison with an evening newspaper, her husband
      with &ldquo;King Solomon&rsquo;s Mines&rdquo;; and Laura, after crisply
      declining an urgent request from Hedrick to play, had disappeared
      upstairs. The inimical lad alone was inspired for the ungrateful role of
      duenna.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat upon the topmost of the porch steps with the air of being
      permanently implanted; leaning forward, elbows on knees, cheeks on palms,
      in a treacherous affectation of profound reverie; and his back (all of him
      that was plainly visible in the hall light) tauntingly close to a delicate
      foot which would, God wot! willingly have launched him into the darkness
      beyond. It was his dreadful pleasure to understand wholly the itching of
      that shapely silk and satin foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gas-light from the hall laid a broad orange path to the steps&mdash;Cora
      and her companion sat just beyond it, his whiteness gray, and she a pale
      ethereality in the shadow. She wore an evening gown that revealed a vague
      lilac through white, and shimmered upon her like a vapour. She was very
      quiet; and there was a wan sweetness about her, an exhalation of
      wistfulness. Cora, in the evening, was more like a rose than ever. She was
      fragrant in the dusk. The spell she cast was an Undine&rsquo;s: it was not
      to be thought so exquisite a thing as she could last. And who may know how
      she managed to say what she did in the silence and darkness? For it was
      said&mdash;without words, without touch, even without a look&mdash;as
      plainly as if she had spoken or written the message: &ldquo;If I am a
      rose, I am one to be worn and borne away. Are you the man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With the fall of night, the street they faced had become still, save for
      an infrequent squawk of irritation on the part of one of the passing
      automobiles, gadding for the most part silently, like fireflies. But after
      a time a strolling trio of negroes came singing along the sidewalk.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;In the evening, by the moonlight, you could hear
      those banjos ringing;
    In the evening, by the moonlight, you could hear
      those darkies singing.
    How the ole folks would injoy it; they would sit
      all night an&rsquo; lis-sun,
    As we sang I-I-N the evening BY-Y-Y the moonlight.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>that</i> takes me back!&rdquo; exclaimed Corliss. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      as it used to be. I might be a boy again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose this old house has many memories for you?&rdquo; said
      Cora, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very many. My, old-maid aunt didn&rsquo;t like me overmuch, I
      believe; and I wasn&rsquo;t here often. My mother and I lived far down the
      street. A big apartment-house stands there now, I noticed as I was walking
      out here this afternoon&mdash;the `Verema,&rsquo; it is called, absurdly
      enough!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ray Vilas lives there,&rdquo; volunteered Hedrick, not altering his
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vilas?&rdquo; said the visitor politely, with a casual recollection
      that the name had been once or twice emphasized by the youth at dinner.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember Vilas among the old names here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t, I guess,&rdquo; said Hedrick. &ldquo;Ray Vilas has
      only been here about two years. He came from Kentucky.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great friend of yours, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t a boy,&rdquo; said Hedrick, and returned to silence
      without further explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How cool and kind the stars are to-night,&rdquo; said Cora, very
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward from her chair, extending a white arm along the iron
      railing of the porch; bending toward Corliss, and speaking toward him and
      away from Hedrick in as low a voice as possible, probably entertaining a
      reasonable hope of not being overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love things that are cool and kind,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      love things that are cool and strong. I love iron.&rdquo; She moved her
      arm caressingly upon the railing. &ldquo;I love its cool, smooth touch.
      Any strong life must have iron in it. I like iron in men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned a very little closer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you iron in you, Mr. Corliss?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the frayed edge of Hedrick&rsquo;s broad white collar was
      lifted perceptibly from his coat, as if by a shudder passing over the back
      and shoulders beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have not,&rdquo; answered Corliss in a low voice, &ldquo;I
      will have&mdash;now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about yourself,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear lady,&rdquo; he began&mdash;and it was an effective beginning,
      for a sigh of pleasure parted her lips as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;there is
      nothing interesting to tell. I have spent a very commonplace life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not. You shouldn&rsquo;t call any life commonplace that has
      escaped <i>this</i>!&rdquo; The lovely voice was all the richer for the
      pain that shook it now. &ldquo;This monotony, this unending desert of
      ashes, this death in life!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This town, you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This prison, I mean! Everything. Tell me what lies outside of it.
      You can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think I can?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to answer that. You understand perfectly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine Corliss drew in his breath with a sound murmurous of delight,
      and for a time they did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, finally, &ldquo;I think I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are meetings in the desert,&rdquo; he went on, slowly.
      &ldquo;A lonely traveller finds another at a spring, sometimes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sometimes they find that they speak the same language?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His answer came, almost in a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`Even as you and I.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`Even as you and I,&rsquo;&rdquo; she echoed, even more faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora breathed rapidly in the silence that followed; she had every
      appearance of a woman deeply and mysteriously stirred. Her companion
      watched her keenly in the dusk, and whatever the reciprocal symptoms of
      emotion he may have exhibited, they were far from tumultuous, bearing more
      likeness to the quiet satisfaction of a good card-player taking what may
      prove to be a decisive trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time she leaned back in her chair again, and began to fan herself
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lived in the Orient, haven&rsquo;t you, Mr. Corliss?&rdquo;
      she said in an ordinary tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not lived. I&rsquo;ve been East once or twice. I spend a greater
      part of the year at Posilipo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the fringe of Naples.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you live in a hotel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; A slight surprise sounded in his voice. &ldquo;I have a
      villa there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what that seems to me?&rdquo; Cora asked gravely, after
      a pause; then answered herself, after another: &ldquo;Like magic. Like a
      strange, beautiful dream.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is beautiful,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell me: What do you do there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spend a lot of time on the water in a boat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sailing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On sapphires and emeralds and turquoises and rubies, melted and
      blown into waves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you go yachting over that glory?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fishing with my crew&mdash;and loafing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your boat is really a yacht, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it might be called anything,&rdquo; he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your sailors are Italian fishermen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick slew a mosquito upon his temple, smiting himself hard. &ldquo;No,
      they&rsquo;re Chinese!&rdquo; he muttered hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re Neapolitans,&rdquo; said Corliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they wear red sashes and earrings?&rdquo; asked Cora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them wears earrings and a derby hat!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she protested, turning to him again. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      tell me. You let me cross-question you, but you don&rsquo;t tell me
      things! Don&rsquo;t you see? I want to know what <i>life</i> is! I want to
      know of strange seas, of strange people, of pain and of danger, of great
      music, of curious thoughts! What are the Neapolitan women like?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They fade early.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned closer to him. &ldquo;Before the fading have you&mdash;have you
      loved&mdash;many?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the pretty ones I ever saw,&rdquo; he answered gayly, but with
      something in his tone (as there was in hers) which implied that all the
      time they were really talking of things other than those spoken. Yet here
      this secret subject seemed to come near the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      She let him hear a genuine little snap of her teeth. &ldquo;I <i>thought</i>
      you were like that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;Ah, but you were sure to see it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could &lsquo;a&rsquo; seen a Neapolitan woman yesterday, Cora,&rdquo;
      said Hedrick, obligingly, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d looked out the front
      window. She was working a hurdy-gurdy up and down this neighbourhood all
      afternoon.&rdquo; He turned genially to face his sister, and added:
      &ldquo;Ray Vilas used to say there were lots of pretty girls in Lexington.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora sprang to her feet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not smoking,&rdquo; she said
      to Corliss hurriedly, as upon a sudden discovery. &ldquo;Let me get you
      some matches.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had entered the house before he could protest, and Hedrick, looking
      down the hall, was acutely aware that she dived desperately into the
      library. But, however tragic the cry for justice she uttered there, it
      certainly was not prolonged; and the almost instantaneous quickness of her
      reappearance upon the porch, with matches in her hand, made this one of
      the occasions when her brother had to admit that in her own line Cora was
      a miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So thoughtless of me,&rdquo; she said cheerfully, resuming her
      seat. She dropped the matches into Mr. Corliss&rsquo;s hand with a
      fleeting touch of her finger-tips upon his palm. &ldquo;Of course you
      wanted to smoke. I can&rsquo;t think why I didn&rsquo;t realize it before.
      I must have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice called from within, commanding in no, uncertain tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hedrick! I should like to see you!&rdquo; Hedrick rose, and,
      looking neither to the right nor, to the left, went stonily into the
      house, and appeared before the powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me?&rdquo; he inquired with the air of cheerful readiness to
      proceed upon any errand, no matter how difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Madison countered diplomacy with gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do with you. Why can&rsquo;t you let
      your sister alone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Laura been complaining of me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hedrick!&rdquo; said Mrs. Madison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick himself felt the justice of her reproof: his reference to Laura
      was poor work, he knew. He hung his head and began to scrape the carpet
      with the side of his shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;d Cora say I been doing to her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know perfectly well what you&rsquo;ve been doing,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Madison sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all; just sitting on the steps. What&rsquo;d she <i>say</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His father evidently considered it wiser not to repeat the text of
      accusation. &ldquo;You know what you did,&rdquo; he said heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; Hedrick&rsquo;s eyes became severe, and his sire&rsquo;s
      evasively shifted from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You keep away from the porch,&rdquo; said the father, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean what I said about Ray Vilas?&rdquo; asked the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both parents looked uncomfortable, and Mr. Madison, turning a leaf in his
      book, gave a mediocre imitation of an austere person resuming his reading
      after an impertinent interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you mean,&rdquo; said the boy accusingly. &ldquo;Ray
      Vilas!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just you keep away from that porch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I happened to mention Ray Vilas?&rdquo; demanded Hedrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You let your sister alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got a right to know what she said, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no response, which appeared to satisfy Hedrick perfectly.
      Neither parent met his glance; the mother troubled and the father dogged,
      while the boy rejoiced sternly in some occult triumph. He inflated his
      scant chest in pomp and hurled at the defeated pair the well-known words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish she was <i>my</i> daughter&mdash;about five minutes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      New sounds from without&mdash;men&rsquo;s voices in greeting, and a ripple
      of response from Cora somewhat lacking in enthusiasm&mdash;afforded Mr.
      Madison unmistakable relief, and an errand upon which to send his deadly
      offspring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick, after a reconnaissance in the hall, obeyed at leisure. Closing
      the library door nonchalantly behind him, he found himself at the foot of
      a flight of unillumined back stairs, where his manner underwent a swift
      alteration, for here was an adventure to be gone about with ceremony.
      &ldquo;Ventre St. Gris!&rdquo; he muttered hoarsely, and loosened the long
      rapier in the shabby sheath at his side. For, with the closing of the
      door, he had become a Huguenot gentleman, over forty and a little grizzled
      perhaps, but modest and unassuming; wiry, alert, lightning-quick, with a
      wrist of steel and a heart of gold; and he was about to ascend the stairs
      of an unknown house at Blois in total darkness. He went up, crouching,
      ready for anything, without a footfall, not even causing a hideous creak;
      and gained the top in safety. Here he turned into an obscure passage, and
      at the end of it beheld, through an open door, a little room in which a
      dark-eyed lady sat writing in a book by the light of an oil lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wary Huguenot remained in the shadow and observed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was writing in an old ledger she had found in the attic, blank and
      unused. She had rebound it herself in heavy gray leather; and fitted it
      with a tiny padlock and key. She wore the key under her dress upon a very
      thin silver chain round her neck. Upon the first page of the book was
      written a date, now more than a year past, the month was June&mdash;and
      beneath it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Love came to me to-day.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Nothing more was written upon that page.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Laura, at this writing, looked piquantly unfamiliar to her brother: her
      eyes were moist and bright; her cheeks were flushed and as she bent low,
      intently close to the book, a loosened wavy strand of her dark hair almost
      touched the page. Hedrick had never before seen her wearing an expression
      so &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; as the eager and tremulous warmth of this;
      though sometimes, at the piano, she would play in a reverie which wrought
      such glamour about her that even a brother was obliged to consider her
      rather handsome. She looked more than handsome now, so strangely lovely,
      in fact, that his eyes watered painfully with the protracted struggle to
      read a little of the writing in her book before she discovered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave it up at last, and lounged forward blinking, with the air of
      finding it sweet to do nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatch&rsquo; writin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked in simple
      carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first sound of his movement she closed the book in a flash; then,
      with a startled, protective gesture, extended her arms over it, covering
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Hedrick?&rdquo; she asked, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the padlock for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;What is it you want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You writin&rsquo; poetry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s eyes dilated; she looked dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care about your old book,&rdquo; said Hedrick,
      with an amused nonchalance Talleyrand might have admired. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      callers, and you have to come down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who sent you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man I&rsquo;ve often noticed around the house,&rdquo; he replied
      blightingly. &ldquo;You may have seen him&mdash;I think his name&rsquo;s
      Madison. His wife and he both sent for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Laura&rsquo;s hands instinctively began to arrange her hair, but
      the other remained upon the book. &ldquo;Who is it calling?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Lindley and that Wade Trumble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura rose, standing between her brother and the table. &ldquo;Tell mother
      I will come down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick moved a little nearer, whereupon, observing his eye, she put her
      right hand behind her upon the book. She was not deceived, and boys are
      not only superb strategic actors sometimes, but calamitously quick.
      Appearing to be unaware of her careful defence, he leaned against the wall
      and crossed his feet in an original and interesting manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course <i>you</i> understand,&rdquo; he said cosily. &ldquo;Cora
      wants to keep this Corliss in a corner of the porch where she can coo at
      him; so you and mother&rsquo;ll have to raise a ballyhoo for Dick Lindley
      and that Wade Trumble. It&rsquo;d been funny if Dick hadn&rsquo;t noticed
      anybody was there and kissed her. What on earth does he want to stay
      engaged to her for, anyway?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that she is engaged to Mr. Lindley, Hedrick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; he hooted. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use talking like
      that to me? A blind mackerel could see she&rsquo;s let poor old Lindley
      think he&rsquo;s High Man with her these last few months; but he&rsquo;ll
      have to hit the pike now, I reckon, &lsquo;cause this Corliss is
      altogether too pe-rin-sley for Dick&rsquo;s class. Lee roy est mort. Vive
      lee roy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hedrick, won&rsquo;t you please run along? I want to change my
      dress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for? There was company for dinner and you didn&rsquo;t change
      then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s flushed cheeks flushed deeper, and in her confusion she
      answered too quickly. &ldquo;I only have one evening gown. I&mdash;of
      course I can&rsquo;t wear it every night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he returned triumphantly, &ldquo;what do you
      want to put it on now for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Please</i> run along, Hedrick,&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t for this Corliss,&rdquo; he persisted sharply.
      &ldquo;You know Dick Lindley couldn&rsquo;t see anybody but Cora to save
      his life, and I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s a girl on earth fool
      enough to dress up for that Wade Trum&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hedrick!&rdquo; Laura&rsquo;s voice rang with a warning which he
      remembered to have heard upon a few previous occasions when she had easily
      proved herself physically stronger than he. &ldquo;Go and tell mother I&rsquo;m
      coming,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to whistle &ldquo;Beulah Land&rdquo; as he went, but, with the
      swift closing of the door behind him, abandoned that pathetically
      optimistic hymn prematurely, after the third bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty minutes later, when Laura came out and went downstairs, a fine
      straight figure in her black evening gown, the Sieur de Marsac&mdash;that
      hard-bitten Huguenot, whose middle-aged shabbiness was but the outward and
      deceptive seeming of the longest head and the best sword in France&mdash;emerged
      cautiously from the passageway and stood listening until her footsteps
      were heard descending the front stairs. Nevertheless, the most painstaking
      search of her room, a search as systematic as it was feverish, failed to
      reveal where she had hidden the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned wearily to the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prophet has always been supposed to take some pleasure, perhaps morbid,
      in seeing his predictions fulfilled; and it may have been a consolation to
      the gloomy heart of Hedrick, sorely injured by Laura&rsquo;s offensive
      care of her treasure, to find the grouping upon the porch as he had
      foretold: Cora and Mr. Corliss sitting a little aloof from the others, far
      enough to permit their holding an indistinct and murmurous conversation of
      their own. Their sequestration, even by so short a distance, gave them an
      appearance of intimacy which probably accounted for the rather absent
      greeting bestowed by Mr. Lindley upon the son of the house, who met him
      with some favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Richard Lindley was a thin, friendly looking young man with a
      pleasing, old-fashioned face which suggested that if he were minded to be
      portrayed it should be by the daguerreotype, and that a high, black stock
      would have been more suitable to him than his businesslike, modern
      neck-gear. He had fine eyes, which seemed habitually concerned with
      faraway things, though when he looked at Cora they sparkled; however, it
      cannot be said that the sparkling continued at its brightest when his
      glance wandered (as it not infrequently did this evening) from her lovely
      head to the rose in Mr. Corliss&rsquo;s white coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick, resuming a position upon the top step between the two groups,
      found the conversation of the larger annoying because it prevented him
      from hearing that of the smaller. It was carried on for the greater part
      by his mother and Mr. Trumble; Laura sat silent between these two; and
      Lindley&rsquo;s mood was obviously contemplative. Mr. Wade Trumble,
      twenty-six, small, earnest, and already beginning to lose his hair, was
      talkative enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one of those people who are so continuously aggressive that they
      are negligible. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter here? Nobody pays any
      attention to me. I&rsquo;M important!&rdquo; He might have had that legend
      engraved on his card, it spoke from everything else that was his: face,
      voice, gesture&mdash;even from his clothes, for they also clamoured for
      attention without receiving it. Worn by another man, their extravagance of
      shape and shade might have advertised a self-sacrificing effort for the
      picturesque; but upon Mr. Trumble they paradoxically confirmed an
      impression that he was well off and close. Certainly this was the
      impression confirmed in the mind of the shrewdest and most experienced
      observer on that veranda. The accomplished Valentine Corliss was quite
      able to share Cora&rsquo;s detachment satisfactorily, and be very actively
      aware of other things at the same time. For instance: Richard Lindley&rsquo;s
      preoccupation had neither escaped him nor remained unconnected in his mind
      with that gentleman&rsquo;s somewhat attentive notice of the present
      position of a certain rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trumble took up Mrs. Madison&rsquo;s placid weather talk as if it had
      been a flaunting challenge; he made it a matter of conscience and for
      argument; for he was a doughty champion, it appeared, when nothings were
      in question, one of those stern men who will have accuracy in the banal,
      insisting upon portent in talk meant to be slid over as mere courteous
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, now,&rdquo; he said with severe
      emphasis. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that at all. I can&rsquo;t say I
      agree with you. In fact, I do not agree with you: it was hotter in the
      early part of July, year before last, than it has been at any time this
      summer. Several degrees hotter&mdash;several degrees.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I must beg to differ with you,&rdquo; he said, catching the
      poor lady again, a moment later. &ldquo;I beg to differ decidedly. Other
      places get a great deal more heat. Look at Egypt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to disagree,&rdquo; he interrupted her at once, when she
      pathetically squirmed to another subject. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than
      one side to this matter. You are looking at this matter from a totally
      wrong angle. . . . Let me inform you that statistics. . . .&rdquo; Mrs.
      Madison&rsquo;s gentle voice was no more than just audible in the short
      intervals he permitted; a blind listener would have thought Mr. Trumble at
      the telephone. Hedrick was thankful when his mother finally gave up
      altogether the display of her ignorance, inaccuracy, and general
      misinformation, and Trumble talked alone. That must have been the young
      man&rsquo;s object; certainly he had struggled for it; and so it must have
      pleased him. He talked on and on and on; he passed from one topic to
      another with no pause; swinging over the gaps with a &ldquo;Now you take,&rdquo;
      or, &ldquo;And that reminds me,&rdquo; filling many a vacancy with &ldquo;So-and-so
      and so-and-so,&rdquo; and other stencils, while casting about for material
      to continue. Everything was italicized, the significant and the trivial,
      to the same monotone of emphasis. Death and shoe-laces were all the same
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anything was all the same to him so long as he talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick&rsquo;s irritation was gradually dispelled; and, becoming used to
      the sound, he found it lulling; relaxed his attitude and drowsed; Mr.
      Lindley was obviously lost in a reverie; Mrs. Madison, her hand shading
      her eyes, went over her market-list for the morrow and otherwise set her
      house in order; Laura alone sat straight in her chair; and her face was
      toward the vocalist, but as she was in deep shadow her expression could
      not be guessed. However, one person in that group must have listened with
      genuine pleasure&mdash;else why did he talk?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the returned native whose departure at last rang the curtain on the
      monologue. The end of the long sheltered seclusion of Cora and her
      companion was a whispered word. He spoke it first:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora gave a keen, quick, indrawn sigh&mdash;not of sorrow&mdash;and sank
      back in her chair, as he touched her hand in farewell and rose to go. She
      remained where she was, motionless and silent in the dark, while he
      crossed to Mrs. Madison, and prefaced a leave-taking unusually formal for
      these precincts with his mannered bow. He shook hands with Richard
      Lindley, asking genially:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you still live where you did&mdash;just below here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I passed by there this afternoon,&rdquo; said Corliss, &ldquo;it
      recalled a stupendous conflict we had, once upon a time; but I couldn&rsquo;t
      remember the cause.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember the cause,&rdquo; said Mr. Lindley, but, stopping rather
      short, omitted to state it. &ldquo;At all events, it was settled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other quietly. &ldquo;You whipped me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I so?&rdquo; Corliss laughed gayly. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t let
      it happen again!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trumble joined the parting guest, making simultaneous adieus with
      unmistakable elation. Mr. Trumble&rsquo;s dreadful entertainment had made
      it a happy evening for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went down the steps together, the top of his head just above the
      level of his companion&rsquo;s shoulder, he lifted to Corliss a searching
      gaze like an actor&rsquo;s hopeful scrutiny of a new acquaintance; and
      before they reached the street his bark rang eagerly on the stilly night:
      &ldquo;Now <i>there</i> is a point on which I beg to differ with you. . .
      .&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Madison gave Lindley her hand. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go in.
      Good-night, Richard. Come, Hedrick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick rose, groaning, and batted his eyes painfully as he faced the hall
      light. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you and this Corliss fight about?&rdquo; he
      asked, sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Lindley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you remembered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I remember a lot of useless things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what was it? I want to know what you fought about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Hedrick,&rdquo; repeated his mother, setting a gently urgent
      hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the boy impatiently, shaking her off and
      growing suddenly very wideawake and determined. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t move
      a step till he tells me what they fought about. Not a step!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;it was about a `show.&rsquo; We were only boys, you know&mdash;younger
      than you, perhaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A circus?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A boy-circus he and my brother got up in our yard. I wasn&rsquo;t
      in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what did you fight about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Val Corliss wasn&rsquo;t quite fair to my brother. That&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t! How wasn&rsquo;t he fair?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They sold tickets to the other boys; and I thought my brother didn&rsquo;t
      get his share.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Corliss kept it all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, something like that,&rdquo; said Lindley, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably I was in the wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he licked you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All over the place!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d seen it,&rdquo; said Hedrick, not
      unsympathetically, but as a sportsman. And he consented to be led away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura had been standing at the top of the steps looking down the street,
      where Corliss and his brisk companion had emerged momentarily from deep
      shadows under the trees into the illumination of a swinging arc-lamp at
      the corner. They disappeared; and she turned, and, smiling, gave the
      delaying guest her hand in good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      His expression, which was somewhat troubled, changed to one of surprise as
      her face came into the light, for it was transfigured. Deeply flushed, her
      eyes luminous, she wore that shining look Hedrick had seen as she wrote in
      her secret book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Laura!&rdquo; said Lindley, wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said good-night again, and went in slowly. As she reached the foot of
      the stairs, she heard him moving a chair upon the porch, and Cora speaking
      sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t sit close to me!&rdquo; There was a sudden
      shrillness in the voice of honey, and the six words were run so rapidly
      together they seemed to form but one. After a moment Cora added, with a
      deprecatory ripple of laughter not quite free from the same shrillness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Richard, it&rsquo;s so&mdash;it&rsquo;s so hot, to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FIVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, when Lindley had gone, Cora closed the front doors in
      a manner which drew an immediate cry of agony from the room where her
      father was trying to sleep. She stood on tiptoe to turn out the gas-light
      in the hall; but for a time the key resisted the insufficient pressure of
      her finger-tips: the little orange flame, with its black-green crescent
      over the armature, so maliciously like the &ldquo;eye&rdquo; of a peacock
      feather, limned the exquisite planes of the upturned face; modelled them
      with soft and regular shadows; painted a sullen loveliness. The key turned
      a little, but not enough; and she whispered to herself a monosyllable not
      usually attributed to the vocabulary of a damsel of rank. Next moment, her
      expression flashed in a brilliant change, like that of a pouting child
      suddenly remembering that tomorrow is Christmas. The key surrendered
      instantly, and she ran gayly up the familiar stairs in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transom of Laura&rsquo;s door shone brightly; but the knob, turning
      uselessly in Cora&rsquo;s hand, proved the door itself not so hospitable.
      There was a brief rustling within the room; the bolt snapped, and Laura
      opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Laura,&rdquo; said Cora, observing her sister with transient
      curiosity, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t undressed. What have you been doing?
      Something&rsquo;s the matter with you. I know what it is,&rdquo; she
      added, laughing, as she seated herself on the edge of the old black-walnut
      bed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in love with Wade Trumble!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a strong man,&rdquo; observed Laura. &ldquo;A remarkable
      throat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrible little person!&rdquo; said Cora, forgetting what she owed
      the unfortunate Mr. Trumble for the vocal wall which had so effectively
      sheltered her earlier in the evening. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like one of those
      booming June-bugs, batting against the walls, falling into lamp-chimneys&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t get very near the light he wants,&rdquo; said
      Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? Yes, he would like to, the rat! But he&rsquo;s consoled when he
      can get any one to listen to his awful chatter. He makes up to himself
      among women for the way he gets sat on at the club. But he has his use: he
      shows off the other men so, by contrast. Oh, Laura!&rdquo; She lifted both
      hands to her cheeks, which were beautiful with a quick suffusion of high
      colour. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he gorgeous!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Laura gently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s the use of that?&rdquo; asked Cora peevishly,
      &ldquo;with <i>me</i>? I didn&rsquo;t mean Richard Lindley. You <i>know</i>
      what I mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;of course&mdash;I do,&rdquo; Laura said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora gave her a long look in which a childlike pleading mingled with a
      faint, strange trouble; then this glance wandered moodily from the face of
      her sister to her own slippers, which she elevated to meet her descending
      line of vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she said, shifting
      quickly to the role of accuser. &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the use of behaving
      like the Pest?&rdquo; She let her feet drop to the floor again, and her
      voice trembled a little as she went on: &ldquo;Laura, you don&rsquo;t know
      what I had to endure from him to-night. I really don&rsquo;t think I can
      stand it to live in the same house any longer with that frightful little
      devil. He&rsquo;s been throwing Ray Vilas&rsquo;s name at me until&mdash;oh,
      it was ghastly to-night! And then&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Her
      tremulousness increased. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said anything about it all
      day, but I <i>met</i> him on the street downtown, this morning&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You met Vilas?&rdquo; Laura looked startled. &ldquo;Did he speak to
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`Speak to me!&rsquo;&rdquo; Cora&rsquo;s exclamation shook with a
      half-laugh of hysteria. &ldquo;He made an awful <i>scene</i>! He came out
      of the Richfield Hotel barroom on Main Street just as I was going into the
      jeweller&rsquo;s next door, and he stopped and bowed like a monkey, square
      in front of me, and&mdash;and he took off his hat and set it on the
      pavement at my feet and told me to kick it into the gutter! Everybody
      stopped and stared; and I couldn&rsquo;t get by him. And he said&mdash;he
      said I&rsquo;d kicked his heart into the gutter and he didn&rsquo;t want
      it to catch cold without a hat! And wouldn&rsquo;t I please be so kind as
      to kick&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She choked with angry mortification. &ldquo;It
      was horrible! People were stopping and laughing, and a rowdy began to make
      fun of Ray, and pushed him, and they got into a scuffle, and I ran into
      the jeweller&rsquo;s and almost fainted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is insane!&rdquo; said Laura, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s nothing of the kind; he&rsquo;s just a brute. He does it
      to make people say I&rsquo;m the cause of his drinking; and everybody in
      this gossipy old town <i>does</i> say it&mdash;just because I got bored to
      death with his everlasting do-you-love-me-to-day-as-well-as-yesterday
      style of torment, and couldn&rsquo;t help liking Richard better. Yes,
      every old cat in town says I ruined him, and that&rsquo;s what he wants
      them to say. It&rsquo;s so unmanly! I wish he&rsquo;d die! Yes, I <i>do</i>
      wish he would! Why doesn&rsquo;t he kill himself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; protested Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? He&rsquo;s threatened to enough. And I&rsquo;m afraid to
      go out of the house because I can&rsquo;t tell when I&rsquo;ll meet him or
      what he&rsquo;ll do. I was almost sick in that jeweller&rsquo;s shop, this
      morning, and so upset I came away without getting my pendant. There&rsquo;s
      <i>another</i> thing I&rsquo;ve got to go through, I suppose!&rdquo; She
      pounded the yielding pillow desperately. &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh! Life isn&rsquo;t
      worth living&mdash;it seems to me sometimes as if everybody in the world
      spent his time trying to think up ways to make it harder for me! I couldn&rsquo;t
      have worn the pendant, though, even if I&rsquo;d got it,&rdquo; she went
      on, becoming thoughtful. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Richard&rsquo;s silly old
      engagement ring, you know,&rdquo; she explained, lightly. &ldquo;I had it
      made up into a pendant, and heaven knows how I&rsquo;m going to get
      Richard to see it the right way. He was so unreasonable tonight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he cross about Mr. Corliss monopolizing you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know how he is,&rdquo; said Cora. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t
      speak of it exactly. But after you&rsquo;d gone, he asked me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      She stopped with a little gulp, an expression of keen distaste about her
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he wants me to wear my ring,&rdquo; she continued, with sudden
      rapidity: &ldquo;and how the dickens <i>can</i> I when I can&rsquo;t even
      tell him it&rsquo;s been made into a pendant! He wants to speak to father;
      he wants to <i>announce</i> it. He&rsquo;s sold out his business for what
      he thinks is a good deal of money, and he wants me to marry him next month
      and take some miserable little trip, I don&rsquo;t know where, for a few
      weeks, before he invests what he&rsquo;s made in another business. Oh!&rdquo;
      she cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <i>horrible</i> thing to ask a girl to do:
      to settle down&mdash;just housekeeping, housekeeping, housekeeping forever
      in this stupid, stupid town! It&rsquo;s so unfair! Men are just
      possessive; they think it&rsquo;s loving you to want to possess you
      themselves. A beautiful `love&rsquo;! It&rsquo;s so mean! Men!&rdquo; She
      sprang up and threw out both arms in a vehement gesture of revolt. &ldquo;Damn
      'em, I wish they&rsquo;d let me <i>alone</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s eyes had lost their quiet; they showed a glint of tears, and
      she was breathing quickly. In this crisis of emotion the two girls went to
      each other silently; Cora turned, and Laura began to unfasten Cora&rsquo;s
      dress in the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Richard!&rdquo; said Laura presently, putting into her mouth a
      tiny pearl button which had detached itself at her touch. &ldquo;This was
      his first evening in the overflow. No wonder he was troubled!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Cora. &ldquo;As if you and mamma weren&rsquo;t
      good enough for him to talk to! He&rsquo;s spoiled. He&rsquo;s so used to
      being called `the most popular man in town&rsquo; and knowing that every
      girl on Corliss Street wanted to marry him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She broke
      off, and exclaimed sharply: &ldquo;I wish they would!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I suppose you mean that&rsquo;s the reason <i>I</i> went in for
      him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; explained Laura hurriedly. &ldquo;I only meant,
      stand still.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was!&rdquo; And Cora&rsquo;s abrupt laugh had the glad,
      free ring fancy attaches to the merry confidences of a buccaneer in
      trusted company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura knelt to continue unfastening the dress; and when it was finished
      she extended three of the tiny buttons in her hand. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      always loose on a new dress,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sew them
      all on tight, to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora smiled lovingly. &ldquo;You good old thing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
      looked pretty to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice!&rdquo; Laura laughed, as she dropped the buttons
      into a little drawer of her bureau. It was an ugly, cheap, old bureau, its
      veneer loosened and peeling, the mirror small and flawed&mdash;a piece of
      furniture in keeping with the room, which was small, plain and hot, its
      only ornamental adjunct being a silver-framed photograph of Mrs. Madison,
      with Cora, as a child of seven or eight, upon her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really do look ever so pretty,&rdquo; asserted Cora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I look as well as I did the last time I heard I was
      pretty,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;That was at the Assembly in March.
      Coming down the stairs, I heard a man from out of town say, `That
      black-haired Miss Madison is a pretty girl.&rsquo; And some one with him
      said, `Yes; you&rsquo;ll think so until you meet her sister!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an old dear!&rdquo; Cora enfolded her delightedly; then,
      drawing back, exclaimed: &ldquo;You <i>know</i> he&rsquo;s gorgeous!&rdquo;
      And with a feverish little ripple of laughter, caught her dress together
      in the back and sped through the hall to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a very different affair from Laura&rsquo;s, much cooler and
      larger; occupying half the width of the house; and a rather expensive
      struggle had made it pretty and even luxurious. The window curtains and
      the wall-paper were fresh, and of a quiet blue; there was a large divan of
      the same colour; a light desk, prettily equipped, occupied a corner; and
      between two gilt gas-brackets, whose patent burners were shielded by
      fringed silk shades, stood a cheval-glass six feet high. The door of a
      very large clothes-pantry stood open, showing a fine company of dresses,
      suspended from forms in an orderly manner; near by, a rosewood cabinet
      exhibited a delicate collection of shoes and slippers upon its four
      shelves. A dressing-table, charmingly littered with everything, took the
      place of a bureau; and upon it, in a massive silver frame, was a large
      photograph of Mr. Richard Lindley. The frame was handsome, but somewhat
      battered: it had seen service. However, the photograph was quite new.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were photographs everywhere&mdash;photographs framed and unframed;
      photographs large and photographs small, the fresh and the faded;
      tintypes, kodaks, &ldquo;full lengths,&rdquo; &ldquo;cabinets,&rdquo;
      groups&mdash;every kind of photograph; and among them were several of Cora
      herself, one of her mother, one of Laura, and two others of girls. All the
      rest were sterner. Two or three were seamed across with cracks, hastily
      recalled sentences to destruction; and here and there remained tokens of a
      draughtsman&rsquo;s over-generous struggle to confer upon some of the
      smooth-shaven faces additional manliness in the shape of sweeping
      moustaches, long beards, goatees, mutton-chops, and, in the case of one
      gentleman of a blond, delicate and tenor-like beauty, neck-whiskers;&mdash;decorations
      in many instances so deeply and damply pencilled that subsequent attempts
      at erasure had failed of great success. Certainly, Hedrick had his own way
      of relieving dull times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora turned up the lights at the sides of the cheval-glass, looked at
      herself earnestly, then absently, and began to loosen her hair. Her lifted
      hands hesitated; she re-arranged the slight displacement of her hair
      already effected; set two chairs before the mirror, seated herself in one;
      pulled up her dress, where it was slipping from her shoulder, rested an
      arm upon the back of the other chair as, earlier in the evening, she had
      rested it upon the iron railing of the porch, and, leaning forward,
      assumed as exactly as possible the attitude in which she had sat so long
      beside Valentine Corliss. She leaned very slowly closer and yet closer to
      the mirror; a rich colour spread over her; her eyes, gazing into
      themselves, became dreamy, inexpressibly wistful, cloudily sweet; her
      breath was tumultuous. &ldquo;`Even as you and I&rsquo;?&rdquo; she
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in the final moment of this after-the-fact rehearsal, as her face
      almost touched the glass, she forgot how and what she had looked to
      Corliss; she forgot him; she forgot him utterly: she leaped to her feet
      and kissed the mirrored lips with a sort of passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>darling</i>!&rdquo; she cried. Cora&rsquo;s christening had
      been unimaginative, for the name means only, &ldquo;maiden.&rdquo; She
      should have been called Narcissa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rhapsody was over instantly, leaving an emotional vacuum like a
      silence at the dentist&rsquo;s. Cora yawned, and resumed the loosening of
      her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had put on her nightgown, she went from one window to another,
      closing the shutters against the coming of the morning light to wake her.
      As she reached the last window, a sudden high wind rushed among the trees
      outside; a white flare leaped at her face, startling her; there was a boom
      and rattle as of the brasses, cymbals, and kettle-drums of some fatal
      orchestra; and almost at once it began to rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that, from the distance came a voice, singing; and at the first
      sound of it, though it was far away and almost indistinguishable, Cora
      started more violently than at the lightning; she sprang to the mirror
      lights, put them out; threw herself upon the bed, and huddled there in the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind passed; the heart of the storm was miles away; this was only its
      fringe; but the rain pattered sharply upon the thick foliage outside her
      windows; and the singing voice came slowly up the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange voice: high-pitched and hoarse&mdash;and not quite human,
      so utter was the animal abandon of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love a lassie, a bonnie, bonnie lassie,&rdquo; it wailed and
      piped, coming nearer; and the gay little air&mdash;wrought to a grotesque
      of itself by this wild, high voice in the rain&mdash;might have been a
      banshee&rsquo;s love-song.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;I love a lassie, a bonnie, bonnie lassie.
    She&rsquo;s as pure as the lily in the dell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The voice grew louder; came in front of the house; came into the yard;
      came and sang just under Cora&rsquo;s window. There it fell silent a
      moment; then was lifted in a long peal of imbecile laughter, and sang
      again:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Then slowly, slowly rase she up
    And slowly she came nigh him,
    And when she drew the curtain by&mdash;
    `Young man I think you&rsquo;re dyin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Cora&rsquo;s door opened and closed softly, and Laura, barefooted, stole
      to the bed and put an arm about the shaking form of her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The drunken beast!&rdquo; sobbed Cora. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to
      disgrace me! That&rsquo;s what he wants. He&rsquo;d like nothing better
      than headlines in the papers: `Ray Vilas arrested at the Madison residence&rsquo;!&rdquo;
      She choked with anger and mortification. &ldquo;The neighbours&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re nearly all away,&rdquo; whispered Laura. &ldquo;You
      needn&rsquo;t fear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice stopped singing, and began to mumble incoherently; then it rose
      again in a lamentable outcry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God of the fallen, be Thou merciful to me! Be Thou merciful&mdash;merciful&mdash;<i>merciful</i>&rdquo;
      . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MERCIFUL, MERCIFUL, MERCIFUL!&rdquo; it shrieked, over and over,
      with increasing loudness, and to such nerve-racking effect that Cora,
      gasping, beat the bedclothes frantically with her hands at each iteration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transom over the door became luminous; some one had lighted the gas in
      the upper hall. Both girls jumped from the bed, ran to the door, and
      opened it. Their mother, wearing a red wrapper, was standing at the head
      of the stairs, which Mr. Madison, in his night-shirt and slippers, was
      slowly and heavily descending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he reached the front door, the voice outside ceased its dreadful
      plaint with the abrupt anti-climax of a phonograph stopped in the middle
      of a record. There was the sound of a struggle and wrestling, a turmoil in
      the wet shrubberies, branches cracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, da&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; cried the voice, drowned again
      at half a word, as by a powerful hand upon a screaming mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man opened the front door, stepped out, closing it behind him; and
      the three women looked at each other wanly during a hushed interval like
      that in a sleeping-car at night when the train stops. Presently he came in
      again, and started up the stairs, heavily and slowly, as he had gone down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Lindley stopped him,&rdquo; he said, sighing with the
      ascent, and not looking up. &ldquo;He heard him as he came along the
      street, and dressed as quick as he could, and ran up and got him. Richard&rsquo;s
      taken him away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to his own room, panting, mopping his damp gray hair with his fat
      wrist, and looking at no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora began to cry again. It was an hour before any of this family had
      recovered sufficient poise to realize, with the shuddering gratitude of
      adventurers spared from the abyss, that, under Providence, Hedrick had not
      wakened!

      CHAPTER SIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Much light shatters much loveliness; but a pretty girl who looks pretty
      outdoors on a dazzling hot summer morning is prettier then than ever. Cora
      knew it; of course she knew it; she knew exactly how she looked, as she
      left the concrete bridge behind her at the upper end of Corliss Street and
      turned into a shrub-bordered bypath of the river park. In imagination she
      stood at the turn of the path just ahead, watching her own approach: she
      saw herself as a picture&mdash;the white-domed parasol, with its cheerful
      pale-green lining, a background for her white hat, her corn-silk hair, and
      her delicately flushed face. She saw her pale, live arms through their
      thin sleeves, and the light grasp of her gloved fingers upon the
      glistening stick of the parasol; she saw the long, simple lines of her
      close white dress and their graceful interchanging movements with the
      alternate advance of her white shoes over the fine gravel path; she saw
      the dazzling splashes of sunshine playing upon her through the changeful
      branches overhead. Cora never lacked a gallery: she sat there herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She refreshed the eyes of a respectable burgess of sixty, a person so
      colourless that no one, after passing him, could have remembered anything
      about him except that he wore glasses and some sort of moustache; and to
      Cora&rsquo;s vision he was as near transparent as any man could be, yet
      she did not miss the almost imperceptible signs of his approval, as they
      met and continued on their opposite ways. She did not glance round, nor
      did he pause in his slow walk; neither was she clairvoyant; none the less,
      she knew that he turned his head and looked back at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path led away from the drives and more public walks of the park, to a
      low hill, thoughtfully untouched by the gardener and left to the shadowy
      thickets and good-smelling underbrush of its rich native woodland. And
      here, by a brown bench, waited a tall gentleman in white.
    </p>
    <p>
      They touched hands and sat without speaking. For several moments they
      continued the silence, then turned slowly and looked at each other; then
      looked slowly and gravely away, as if to an audience in front of them.
      They knew how to do it; but probably a critic in the first row would have
      concluded that Cora felt it even more than Valentine Corliss enjoyed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose this is very clandestine,&rdquo; she said, after a deep
      breath. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I care, though.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you do,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;so that I could think your
      coming means more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll care,&rdquo; she said, and looked at him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear!&rdquo; he exclaimed deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bit her lip and looked down, but not before he had seen the quick
      dilation of her ardent eyes. &ldquo;I wanted to be out of doors,&rdquo;
      she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s one thing of yours I don&rsquo;t
      like, Mr. Corliss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll throw it away, then. Tell me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your house. I don&rsquo;t like living in it, very much. I&rsquo;m
      sorry you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> throw it away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of doing that very thing,&rdquo; he laughed.
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad I found the rose in that queer old waste-basket
      first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too much like a rose, sometimes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      think this morning I&rsquo;m a little like some of the old doors up on the
      third floor: I feel rather unhinged, Mr. Corliss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look it, Miss Madison!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t sleep very well.&rdquo; She bestowed upon him a
      glance which transmuted her actual explanation into, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
      sleep for thinking of you.&rdquo; It was perfectly definite; but the acute
      gentleman laughed genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on with you!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes sparkled, and she joined laughter with him. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
      true: you did keep me awake. Besides, I had a serenade.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serenade? I had an idea they didn&rsquo;t do that any more over
      here. I remember the young men going about at night with an orchestra
      sometimes when I was a boy, but I supposed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t much like that,&rdquo; she interrupted,
      carelessly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that sort of thing has been done
      for years and years. It wasn&rsquo;t an orchestra&mdash;just a man singing
      under my window.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a guitar?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; She laughed a little. &ldquo;Just singing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it rained last night,&rdquo; said Corliss, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>he</i> wouldn&rsquo;t mind that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stupid of me! Of course, he wouldn&rsquo;t. Was it Richard
      Lindley?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Yes, that was a bad guess: I&rsquo;m sure Lindley&rsquo;s
      just the same steady-going, sober, plodding old horse he was as a boy. His
      picture doesn&rsquo;t fit a romantic frame&mdash;singing under a lady&rsquo;s
      window in a thunderstorm! Your serenader must have been very young.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Cora. &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s about
      twenty-three; just a boy&mdash;and a very annoying one, too!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion looked at her narrowly. &ldquo;By any chance, is he the
      person your little brother seemed so fond of mentioning&mdash;Mr. Vilas?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora gave a genuine start. &ldquo;Good heavens! What makes you think that?&rdquo;
      she cried, but she was sufficiently disconcerted to confirm his amused
      suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was Mr. Vilas,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of the
      jilted, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, `jilted&rsquo;!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;All the wild boys
      that a girl can&rsquo;t make herself like aren&rsquo;t `jilted,&rsquo; are
      they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I should say&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;Yes,
      in this instance, just about all of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is every woman a target for you, Mr. Corliss? I suppose you know
      that you have a most uncomfortable way of shooting up the landscape.&rdquo;
      She stirred uneasily, and moved away from him to the other end of the
      bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t miss that time,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you ever miss?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned quickly toward her and answered in a low voice: &ldquo;You can
      be sure I&rsquo;m not going to miss anything about <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if his bending near her had been to rouge her. But it cannot be
      said that she disliked his effect upon her; for the deep breath she drew
      in audibly, through her shut teeth, was a signal of delight; and then
      followed one of those fraught silences not uncharacteristic of dialogues
      with Cora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, she gracefully and uselessly smoothed her hair from the left
      temple with the backs of her fingers, of course finishing the gesture
      prettily by tucking in a hairpin tighter above the nape of her neck. Then,
      with recovered coolness, she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come all the way from Italy just to sell our old house, Mr.
      Corliss?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that was part of why I came,&rdquo; he said, gayly. &ldquo;I
      need a great deal of money, Miss Cora Madison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your villa and your yacht?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m a magician, dear lady&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, almost angrily. &ldquo;Of course you know it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mock me! No; I&rsquo;m going to make everybody rich who will
      trust me. I have a secret, and it&rsquo;s worth a mountain of gold. I&rsquo;ve
      put all I have into it, and will put in everything else I can get for
      myself, but it&rsquo;s going to take a great deal more than that. And
      everybody who goes into it will come out on Monte Cristo&rsquo;s island.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m sorry papa hasn&rsquo;t anything to put in,&rdquo;
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has: his experience in business and his integrity. I want
      him to be secretary of my company. Will you help me to get him?&rdquo; he
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to?&rdquo; she asked with a quick, serious glance
      straight in his eyes, one which he met admirably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an extremely definite impression,&rdquo; he said lightly,
      &ldquo;that you can make anybody you know do just what you want him to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have another that you have still another `extremely definite
      impression&rsquo; that takes rank over that,&rdquo; she said, but not with
      his lightness, for her tone was faintly rueful. &ldquo;It is that you can
      make <i>me</i> do just what you want me to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Valentine Corliss threw himself back on the bench and laughed aloud.
      &ldquo;What a girl!&rdquo; he cried. Then for a fraction of a second he
      set his hand over hers, an evanescent touch at which her whole body
      started and visibly thrilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her gloved hand and looked at it with an odd wonder; her alert
      emotions, always too ready, flinging their banners to her cheeks again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s soiled,&rdquo; he said, a speech
      which she punished with a look of starry contempt. For an instant she made
      him afraid that something had gone wrong with his measuring tape; but with
      a slow movement she set her hand softly against her hot cheek; and he was
      reassured: it was not his touching her that had offended her, but the
      allusion to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, very softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her hand to her parasol, and began, musingly, to dig little
      holes in the gravel of the path. &ldquo;Richard Lindley is looking for
      investments,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear he&rsquo;s been so successful,&rdquo;
      returned Corliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might like a share in your gold-mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heaven it isn&rsquo;t literally a gold-mine,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;There have been so many crooked ones exploited I don&rsquo;t
      believe you could get anybody nowadays to come in on a real one. But I
      think you&rsquo;d make an excellent partner for an adventurer who had
      discovered hidden treasure; and I&rsquo;m that particular kind of
      adventurer. I think I&rsquo;ll take you in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you like to save a man from being ruined?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruined? You don&rsquo;t mean it literally?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Literally!&rdquo; He laughed gayly. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t `land&rsquo;
      this I&rsquo;m gone, smashed, finished&mdash;quite ended! Don&rsquo;t
      bother, I&rsquo;m going to `land&rsquo; it. And it&rsquo;s rather a
      serious compliment I&rsquo;m paying you, thinking you can help me. I&rsquo;d
      like to see a woman&mdash;just once in the world&mdash;who could manage a
      thing like this.&rdquo; He became suddenly very grave. &ldquo;Good God!
      wouldn&rsquo;t I be at her feet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes became even more eager. &ldquo;You think I&mdash;I <i>might</i>
      be a woman who could?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows, Miss Madison? I believe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped
      abruptly, then in a lowered, graver voice asked: &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it
      somehow seem a little queer to you when we call each other, `Miss Madison&rsquo;
      and `Mr. Corliss&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered slowly; &ldquo;it does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem to you,&rdquo; he went on, in the same tone,
      &ldquo;that we only `Miss&rsquo; and `Mister&rsquo; each other in fun?
      That though you never saw me until yesterday, we&rsquo;ve gone pretty far
      beyond mere surfaces? That we did in our talk, last night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;it does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He let a pause follow, and then said huskily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far are we going?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; She was barely audible; but she turned
      deliberately, and there took place an eager exchange of looks which
      continued a long while. At last, and without ending this serious
      encounter, she whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far do <i>you</i> think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Corliss did not answer, and a peculiar phenomenon became vaguely
      evident to the girl facing him: his eyes were still fixed full upon hers,
      but he was not actually looking at her; nevertheless, and with an
      extraordinarily acute attention, he was unquestionably looking at
      something. The direct front of pupil and iris did not waver from her; but
      for the time he was not aware of her; had not even heard her question.
      Something in the outer field of his vision had suddenly and completely
      engrossed him; something in that nebulous and hazy background which we
      see, as we say, with the white of the eye. Cora instinctively turned and
      looked behind her, down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one in sight except a little girl and the elderly burgess who
      had glanced over his shoulder at Cora as she entered the park; and he was,
      in face, mien, and attire, so thoroughly the unnoticeable, average
      man-on-the-street that she did not even recall him as the looker-round of
      a little while ago. He was strolling benevolently, the little girl
      clinging to one of his hands, the other holding an apple; and a composite
      photograph of a thousand grandfathers might have resulted in this man&rsquo;s
      picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the man and little girl came slowly up the walk toward the couple on
      the bench there was a faint tinkle at Cora&rsquo;s feet: her companion&rsquo;s
      scarfpin, which had fallen from his tie. He was maladroit about picking it
      up, trying with thumb and forefinger to seize the pin itself, instead of
      the more readily grasped design of small pearls at the top, so that he
      pushed it a little deeper into the gravel; and then occurred a tiny
      coincidence: the elderly man, passing, let fall the apple from his hand,
      and it rolled toward the pin just as Corliss managed to secure the latter.
      For an instant, though the situation was so absolutely commonplace, so
      casual, Cora had a wandering consciousness of some mysterious tensity; a
      feeling like the premonition of a crisis very near at hand. This sensation
      was the more curious because nothing whatever happened. The man got his
      apple, joined in the child&rsquo;s laughter, and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it you asked me?&rdquo; said Corliss, lifting his head
      again and restoring the pin to his tie. He gazed carelessly at the back of
      the grandsire, disappearing beyond a bush at a bend in the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that man?&rdquo; said Cora with some curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That old fellow? I haven&rsquo;t an idea. You see I&rsquo;ve been
      away from here so many years I remember almost no one. Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, unless it was because I had an idea you were
      thinking of him instead of me. You didn&rsquo;t listen to what I said.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was because I was thinking so intensely of you,&rdquo; he
      began instantly. &ldquo;A startlingly vivid thought of you came to me just
      then. Didn&rsquo;t I look like a man in a trance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the thought?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a picture: I saw you standing under a great bulging sail,
      and the water flying by in moonlight; oh, a moon and a night such as you
      have never seen! and a big blue headland looming up against the moon, and
      crowned with lemon groves and vineyards, all sparkling with fireflies&mdash;old
      watch-towers and the roofs of white villas gleaming among olive orchards
      on the slopes&mdash;the sound of mandolins&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she sighed, the elderly man, his grandchild, and his
      apple well-forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it was a prophecy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> think?&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;That was
      really what I asked you before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m in danger of
      forgetting that my `hidden treasure&rsquo; is the most important thing in
      the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In great danger?&rdquo; The words were not vocal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved close to her; their eyes met again, with increased eagerness, and
      held fast; she was trembling, visibly; and her lips&mdash;parted with her
      tumultuous breathing&mdash;were not far from his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t any man in great danger,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if he
      falls in love with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER SEVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Toward four o&rsquo;clock that afternoon, a very thin, fair young man
      shakily heaved himself into a hammock under the trees in that broad
      backyard wherein, as Valentine Corliss had yesterday noticed, the last
      iron monarch of the herd, with unabated arrogance, had entered domestic
      service as a clothes-prop. The young man, who was of delicate appearance
      and unhumanly pale, stretched himself at full length on his back, closed
      his eyes, moaned feebly, cursed the heat in a stricken whisper. Then, as a
      locust directly overhead violently shattered the silence, and seemed like
      to continue the outrage forever, the shaken lounger stopped his ears with
      his fingers and addressed the insect in old Saxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A white jacketed mulatto came from the house bearing something on a silver
      tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julip, Mist&rsquo; Vilas?&rdquo; he said sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ray Vilas rustily manoeuvred into a sitting position; and, with eyes still
      closed, made shift to accept the julep in both hands, drained half of it,
      opened his eyes, and thanked the cup-bearer feebly, in a voice and accent
      reminiscent of the melodious South.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I wonder,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if you can tell me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Miz William Lindley&rsquo;s house-man, Joe Vaxdens,&rdquo;
      said the mulatto, in the tone of an indulgent nurse. &ldquo;You in Miz
      Lindley&rsquo;s backyard right now, sittin&rsquo; in a hammick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seem to gather almost that much for myself,&rdquo; returned the
      patient. &ldquo;But I should like to know how I got here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jes&rsquo; come out the front door an&rsquo; walk&rsquo; aroun&rsquo;
      the house an&rsquo; set down. Mist&rsquo; Richard had to go downtown; tole
      me not to wake you; but I heerd you splashin&rsquo; in the bath an&rsquo;
      you tole me you din&rsquo; want no breakfuss&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Joe, I&rsquo;m aware of what&rsquo;s occurred since I woke,&rdquo;
      said Vilas, and, throwing away the straws, finished the julep at one
      draught. &ldquo;What I want to know is how I happened to be here at Mr.
      Lindley&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mist&rsquo; Richard brought you las&rsquo; night, suh. I don&rsquo;
      know where he got you, but I heered a considerable thrashum aroun&rsquo;,
      up an&rsquo; down the house, an&rsquo; so I come help him git you to bed
      in one vem spare-rooms.&rdquo; Joe chuckled ingratiatingly. &ldquo;Lord
      name! You cert&rsquo;n&rsquo;y wasn&rsquo;t askin&rsquo; fer no <i>bed</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the glass, and the young man reclined again in the hammock, a hot
      blush vanquishing his pallor. &ldquo;Was I&mdash;was I very bad, Joe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you was all <i>right</i>,&rdquo; Joe hastened to reassure him.
      &ldquo;You was jes&rsquo; on&rsquo;y a little bit tight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it really seem only a little?&rdquo; the other asked hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessuh,&rdquo; said Joe promptly. &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; at all. You
      jes&rsquo; wanted to rare roun&rsquo; little bit. Mist&rsquo; Richard took
      gun away from you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I tole him you wasn&rsquo; goin&rsquo; use it!&rdquo; Joe
      laughed. &ldquo;But you so wile be din&rsquo; know what you do. You cert&rsquo;n&rsquo;y
      was drunkes&rsquo; man <i>I</i> see in <i>long</i> while,&rdquo; he said
      admiringly. &ldquo;You pert near had us bofe wore out &lsquo;fore you give
      up, an&rsquo; Mist&rsquo; Richard an&rsquo; me, we <i>use&rsquo;&rsquo;</i>
      to han&rsquo;lin&rsquo; drunkum man, too&mdash;use&rsquo; to have big
      times week-in, week-out &lsquo;ith Mist&rsquo; Will&mdash;at&rsquo;s Mist&rsquo;
      Richard&rsquo;s brother, you know, suh, what died o&rsquo; whiskey.&rdquo;
      He laughed again in high good-humour. &ldquo;You cert&rsquo;n&rsquo;y laid
      it all over any vem ole times we had &lsquo;ith Mist&rsquo; Will!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vilas shifted his position in the hammock uneasily; Joe&rsquo;s honest
      intentions to be of cheer to the sufferer were not wholly successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tole Mist&rsquo; Richard,&rdquo; the kindly servitor continued,
      &ldquo;it was a mighty good thing his ma gone up Norf endurin&rsquo; the
      hot spell. Sence Mist&rsquo; Will die she can&rsquo;t hardly bear to see
      drunkum man aroun&rsquo; the house. Mist&rsquo; Richard hardly ever tech
      nothin&rsquo; himself no more. You goin&rsquo; feel better, suh, out in
      the f&rsquo;esh air,&rdquo; he concluded, comfortingly as he moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessuh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vilas pulled himself upright for a moment. &ldquo;What use in the
      world do you reckon one julep is to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mist&rsquo; Richard say to give you one drink ef you ask&rsquo; for
      it, suh,&rdquo; answered Joe, looking troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve told me enough now about last night to make any
      man hang himself, and I&rsquo;m beginning to remember enough more&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw, Mist&rsquo; Vilas,&rdquo; the coloured man interrupted,
      deprecatingly, &ldquo;you din&rsquo; broke nothin&rsquo;! You on&rsquo;y
      had couple glass&rsquo; wine too much. You din&rsquo; make no trouble at
      all; jes&rsquo; went right off to bed. You ought seen some vem ole times
      me an Mist&rsquo; Richard use to have &lsquo;ith Mist&rsquo; Will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessuh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want three more juleps and I want them right away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The troubled expression upon the coloured man&rsquo;s face deepened.
      &ldquo;Mist&rsquo; Richard say jes&rsquo; one, suh,&rdquo; he said
      reluctantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessuh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Ray Vilas slowly, &ldquo;whether or
      not you ever heard that I was born and raised in Kentucky.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessuh,&rdquo; returned Joe humbly. &ldquo;I heerd so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the young man in a quiet voice, &ldquo;you
      go and get me three juleps. I&rsquo;ll settle it with Mr. Richard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessuh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was with a fifth of these renovators that Lindley found his guest
      occupied, an hour later, while upon a small table nearby a sixth,
      untouched, awaited disposal beside an emptied coffee-cup. Also, Mr. Vilas
      was smoking a cigarette with unshadowed pleasure; his eye was bright, his
      expression care-free; and he was sitting up in the hammock, swinging
      cheerfully, and singing the &ldquo;Marseillaise.&rdquo; Richard approached
      through the yard, coming from the street without entering the house; and
      anxiety was manifest in the glance he threw at the green-topped glass upon
      the table, and in his greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hail, gloom!&rdquo; returned Mr. Vilas, cordially, and, observing
      the anxious glance, he swiftly removed the untouched goblet from the table
      to his own immediate possession. &ldquo;Two simultaneous juleps will
      enhance the higher welfare,&rdquo; he explained airily. &ldquo;Sir, your
      Mr. Varden was induced to place a somewhat larger order with us than he
      protested to be your intention. Trusting you to exonerate him from all
      so-and-so and that these few words, etcetera!&rdquo; He depleted the elder
      glass of its liquor, waved it in the air, cried, &ldquo;Health, host!&rdquo;
      and set it upon the table. &ldquo;I believe I do not err in assuming my
      cup-bearer&rsquo;s name to be Varden, although he himself, in his simple
      Americo-Africanism, is pleased to pluralize it. Do I fret you, host?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said Richard, dropping upon a rustic
      bench, and beginning to fan himself with his straw hat. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      the use of fretting about a boy who hasn&rsquo;t sense enough to fret
      about himself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`Boy?&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr. Vilas affected puzzlement. &ldquo;Do I hear
      aright? Sir, do you boy me? Bethink you, I am now the shell of five
      mint-juleps plus, and am pot-valiant. And is this mere capacity itself to
      be lightly <i>boyed</i>? Again, do I not wear a man&rsquo;s garment, a man&rsquo;s
      garnitures? Heed your answer; for this serge, these flannels, and these
      silks are yours, and though I may not fill them to the utmost, I do to the
      longmost, precisely. I am the stature of a man; had it not been for your
      razor I should wear the beard of a man; therefore I&rsquo;ll not be boyed.
      What have you to say in defence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better let me get Joe to bring you something to
      eat?&rdquo; asked Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat?&rdquo; Mr. Vilas disposed of the suggestion with mournful
      hauteur. &ldquo;There! For the once I forgive you. Let the subject never
      be mentioned between us again. We will tactfully turn to a topic of
      interest. My memories of last evening, at first hazy and somewhat
      disconcerting, now merely amuse me. Following the pleasant Spanish custom,
      I went a-serenading, but was kidnapped from beneath the precious casement
      by&mdash;by a zealous arrival. Host, `zealous arrival&rsquo; is not the
      julep in action: it is a triumph of paraphrase.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d let Joe take you back to bed,&rdquo; said
      Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always bent on thoughts of the flesh,&rdquo; observed the other
      sadly. &ldquo;Beds are for bodies, and I am become a thing of spirit. My
      soul is grateful a little for your care of its casing. You behold, I am
      generous: I am able to thank my successor to Carmen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lindley&rsquo;s back stiffened. &ldquo;Vilas!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare me your protests.&rdquo; The younger man waved his hand
      languidly. &ldquo;You wish not to confer upon this subject&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a subject we&rsquo;ll omit,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion stopped swinging, allowed the hammock to come to rest; his
      air of badinage fell from him; for the moment he seemed entirely sober;
      and he spoke with gentleness. &ldquo;Mr. Lindley, if you please, I am
      still a gentleman&mdash;at times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Richard quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need of that!&rdquo; The speaker&rsquo;s former careless and
      boisterous manner instantly resumed possession. &ldquo;You must permit me
      to speak of a wholly fictitious lady, a creature of my wanton fancy, sir,
      whom I call Carmen. It will enable me to relieve my burdened soul of some
      remarks I have long wished to address to your excellent self.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; muttered Richard, much annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us imagine,&rdquo; continued Mr. Vilas, beginning to swing
      again, &ldquo;that I thought I had won this Carmen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lindley uttered an exclamation, shifted his position in his chair, and
      fixed a bored attention upon the passing vehicles in the glimpse of the
      street afforded between the house and the shrubberies along the side
      fence. The other, without appearing to note his annoyance, went on,
      cheerfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a precocious huntress: early in youth she passed through
      the accumulator stage, leaving it to the crude or village belle to rejoice
      in numbers and the excitement of teasing cubs in the bear-pit. It is the
      nature of this imagined Carmen to play fiercely with one imitation of love
      after another: a man thinks he wins her, but it is merely that she has
      chosen him&mdash;for a while. And Carmen can have what she chooses; if the
      man exists who could show her that she cannot, she would follow him
      through the devil&rsquo;s dance; but neither you nor I would be that man,
      my dear sir. We assume that Carmen&rsquo;s eyes have been mine&mdash;her
      heart is another matter&mdash;and that she has grown weary of my somewhat
      Sicilian manner of looking into them, and, following her nature and the
      law of periodicity which Carmens must bow to, she seeks a cooler gaze and
      calls Mr. Richard Lindley to come and take a turn at looking. Now, Mr.
      Richard Lindley is straight as a die: he will not even show that he hears
      the call until he is sure that I have been dismissed: therefore, I have no
      quarrel with him. Also, I cannot even hate him, for in my clearer julep
      vision I see that he is but an interregnum. Let me not offend my friend:
      chagrin is to be his as it is mine. I was a strong draught, he but the
      quieting potion our Carmen took to settle it. We shall be brothers in woe
      some day. Nothing in the universe lasts except Hell: Life is running
      water; Love, a looking-glass; Death, an empty theatre! That reminds me: as
      you are not listening I will sing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished his drink and lifted his voice hilariously:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;The heavenly stars far above her,
      The wind of the infinite sea,
    Who know all her perfidy, love her,
      So why call it madness in me?
      Ah, why call it madness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He set his glass with a crash upon the table, staring over his companion&rsquo;s
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What</i>, if you please, is the royal exile who thus seeks
      refuge in our hermitage?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His host had already observed the approaching visitor with some surprise,
      and none too graciously. It was Valentine Corliss: he had turned in from
      the street and was crossing the lawn to join the two young men. Lindley
      rose, and, greeting him with sufficient cordiality, introduced Mr. Vilas,
      who bestowed upon the newcomer a very lively interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as welcome, Mr. Corliss,&rdquo; said this previous guest,
      earnestly, &ldquo;as if these sylvan shades were mine. I hail you, not
      only for your own sake, but because your presence encourages a hope that
      our host may offer refreshment to the entire company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Corliss smilingly declined to be a party to this diplomacy, and seated
      himself beside Richard Lindley on the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I relapse!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Vilas, throwing himself back
      full-length in the hammock. &ldquo;I am not replete, but content. I shall
      meditate. Gentlemen, speak on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand in a gracious gesture, indicating his intention to
      remain silent, and lay quiet, his eyes fixed steadfastly upon Corliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was coming to call on you,&rdquo; said the latter to Lindley,
      &ldquo;but I saw you from the street and thought you mightn&rsquo;t mind
      my being as informal as I used to be, so many years ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a sinister purpose in coming,&rdquo; Mr. Corliss laughingly
      went on. &ldquo;I want to bore you a little first, and then make your
      fortune. No doubt that&rsquo;s an old story to you, but I happen to be one
      of the adventurers whose argosies are laden with real cargoes. Nobody
      knows who has or hasn&rsquo;t money to invest nowadays, and of course I&rsquo;ve
      no means of knowing whether <i>you</i> have or not&mdash;you see what a
      direct chap I am&mdash;but if you have, or can lay hold of some, I can
      show you how to make it bring you an immense deal more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said Richard pleasantly, &ldquo;I shall be glad
      if you can do that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll come to the point. It is exceedingly simple; that&rsquo;s
      certainly one attractive thing about it.&rdquo; Corliss took some papers
      and unmounted photographs from his pocket, and began to spread them open
      on the bench between himself and Richard. &ldquo;No doubt you know
      Southern Italy as well as I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t `know&rsquo; it. I&rsquo;ve been to Naples; down
      to Paestum; drove from Salerno to Sorrentoby Amalfi; but that was years
      ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a large scale map that will refresh your memory.&rdquo;
      He unfolded it and laid it across their knees; it was frayed with wear
      along the folds, and had been heavily marked and dotted with red and blue
      pencillings. &ldquo;My millions are in this large irregular section,&rdquo;
      he continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the anklebone and instep of Italy&rsquo;s
      boot; this sizable province called Basilicata, east of Salerno, north of
      Calabria. And I&rsquo;ll not hang fire on the point, Lindley. What I&rsquo;ve
      got there is oil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olives?&rdquo; asked Richard, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly!&rdquo; Corliss laughed. &ldquo;Though of course one doesn&rsquo;t
      connect petroleum with the thought of Italy, and of all Italy, Southern
      Italy. But in spite of the years I&rsquo;ve lived there, I&rsquo;ve
      discovered myself to be so essentially American and commercial that I want
      to drench the surface of that antique soil with the brown, bad-smelling
      crude oil that lies so deep beneath it. Basilicata is the coming great
      oil-field of the world&mdash;and that&rsquo;s my secret. I dare to tell it
      here, as I shouldn&rsquo;t dare in Naples.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t `dare&rsquo;?&rdquo; Richard repeated, with growing
      interest, and no doubt having some vague expectation of a tale of the
      Camorra. To him Naples had always seemed of all cities the most elusive
      and incomprehensible, a laughing, thieving, begging, mandolin-playing,
      music-and-murder haunted metropolis, about which anything was plausible;
      and this impression was not unique, as no inconsiderable proportion of Mr.
      Lindley&rsquo;s fellow-countrymen share it, a fact thoroughly comprehended
      by the returned native.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a case of not daring on account of any bodily
      danger,&rdquo; explained Corliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Richard smiled reminiscently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      believe that would have much weight with you if it were. You certainly
      showed no symptoms of that sort in your extreme youth. I remember you had
      the name of being about the most daring and foolhardy boy in town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grew up to be cautious enough in business, though,&rdquo; said
      the other, shaking his head gravely. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been able to
      afford not being careful.&rdquo; He adjusted the map&mdash;a prefatory
      gesture. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll make this whole affair perfectly clear to
      you. It&rsquo;s a simple matter, as are most big things. I&rsquo;ll begin
      by telling you of Moliterno&mdash;he&rsquo;s been my most intimate friend
      in that part of the continent for a great many years; since I went there
      as a boy, in fact.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sketched a portrait of his friend, Prince Moliterno, bachelor chief of
      a historic house, the soul of honour, &ldquo;land-poor&rdquo;; owning
      leagues and leagues of land, hills and mountains, broken towers and ruins,
      in central Basilicata, a province described as wild country and rough, off
      the rails and not easy to reach. Moliterno and the narrator had gone there
      to shoot; Corliss had seen &ldquo;surface oil&rdquo; upon the streams and
      pools; he recalled the discovery of oil near his own boyhood home in
      America; had talked of it to Moliterno, and both men had become more and
      more interested, then excited. They decided to sink a well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corliss described picturesquely the difficulties of this enterprise, the
      hardships and disappointments; how they dragged the big tools over the
      mountains by mule power; how they had kept it all secret; how he and
      Moliterno had done everything with the help of peasant labourers and one
      experienced man, who had &ldquo;seen service in the Persian oil-fields.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave the business reality, colouring it with details relevant and
      irrelevant, anecdotes and wayside incidents: he was fluent, elaborate,
      explicit throughout. They sank five wells, he said, &ldquo;at the angles
      of this irregular pentagon you see here on the map, outlined in blue.
      These red circles are the wells.&rdquo; Four of the wells &ldquo;came in
      tremendous,&rdquo; but they had managed to get them sealed after wasting&mdash;he
      was &ldquo;sorry to think how many thousand barrels of oil.&rdquo; The
      fifth well was so enormous that they had not been able to seal it at the
      time of the speaker&rsquo;s departure for America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I had a cablegram this morning,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;letting
      me know they&rsquo;ve managed to do it at last. Here is, the cablegram.&rdquo;
      He handed Richard a form signed &ldquo;Antonio Moliterno.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, to go back to what I said about not `daring&rsquo; to speak of
      this in Naples,&rdquo; he continued, smiling. &ldquo;The fear is
      financial, not physical.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge of the lucky strike, he explained, must be kept from the
      &ldquo;Neapolitan money-sharks.&rdquo; A third of the land so rich in oil
      already belonged to the Moliterno estates, but it was necessary to obtain
      possession of the other two thirds &ldquo;before the secret leaks into
      Naples.&rdquo; So far, it was safe, the peasants of Basilicata being
      &ldquo;as medieval a lot as one could wish.&rdquo; He related that these
      peasants thought that the devils hiding inside the mountains had been
      stabbed by the drills, and that the oil was devils&rsquo; blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see some of the country people hanging about, staring at a
      well, in this kodak, though it&rsquo;s not a very good one.&rdquo; He put
      into Richard&rsquo;s hand a small, blurred photograph showing a spouting
      well with an indistinct crowd standing in an irregular semicircle before
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the Basilicatan peasant costume?&rdquo; asked Richard,
      indicating a figure in the foreground, the only one revealed at all
      definitely. &ldquo;It looks more oriental. Isn&rsquo;t the man wearing a
      fez?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; responded Mr. Corliss very quickly. &ldquo;Perhaps
      I gave you the wrong picture. Oh, no,&rdquo; he laughed easily, holding
      the kodak closer to his eyes; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all right: it is a fez.
      That&rsquo;s old Salviati, our engineer, the man I spoke of who&rsquo;d
      worked in Persia, you know; he&rsquo;s always worn a fez since then. Got
      in the habit of it out there and says he&rsquo;ll never give it up.
      Moliterno&rsquo;s always chaffing him about it. He&rsquo;s a faithful old
      chap, Salviati.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Lindley looked thoughtfully at the picture, which the
      other carelessly returned to his hand. &ldquo;There seems to be a lot of
      oil there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the smaller wells at that. And you can see from
      the kodak that it&rsquo;s just `blowing&rsquo;&mdash;not an eruption from
      being `shot,&rsquo; or the people wouldn&rsquo;t stand so near. Yes; there&rsquo;s
      an ocean of oil under that whole province; but we want a lot of money to
      get at it. It&rsquo;s mountain country; our wells will all have to go over
      fifteen-hundred feet, and that&rsquo;s expensive. We want to pipe the oil
      to Salerno, where the Standard&rsquo;s ships will take it from us, and it
      will need a great deal for that. But most of all we want money to get hold
      of the land; we must control the whole field, and it&rsquo;s big!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you happen to come here to finance it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was getting to that. Moliterno himself is as honourable a man as
      breathes God&rsquo;s air. But my experience has been that Neapolitan
      capitalists are about the cleverest and slipperiest financiers in the
      world. We could have financed it twenty times over in Naples in a day, but
      neither Moliterno nor I was willing to trust them. The thing is enormous,
      you see&mdash;a really colossal fortune&mdash;and Italian law is full of
      ins and outs, and the first man we talked to confidentially would have
      given us his word to play straight, and, the instant we left him, would
      have flown post-haste for Basilicata and grabbed for himself the two
      thirds of the field not yet in our hands. Moliterno and I talked it over
      many, many times; we thought of going to Rome for the money, to Paris, to
      London, to New York; but I happened to remember the old house here that my
      aunt had left me&mdash;I wanted to sell it, to add whatever it brought to
      the money I&rsquo;ve already put in&mdash;and then it struck me I might
      raise the rest here as well as anywhere else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded. &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll think me rather sentimental,&rdquo; Corliss
      went on, with a laugh which unexpectedly betrayed a little shyness.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never forgotten that I was born here&mdash;was a boy
      here. In all my wanderings I&rsquo;ve always really thought of this as
      home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice trembled slightly and his face flushed; he smiled deprecatingly
      as though in apology for these symptoms of emotion; and at that both
      listeners felt (perhaps with surprise) the man&rsquo;s strong attraction.
      There was something very engaging about him: in the frankness of his look
      and in the slight tremor in his voice; there was something appealing and
      yet manly in the confession, by this thoroughgoing cosmopolite, of his
      real feeling for the home-town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know how very few people, even among the `old citizens,&rsquo;
      would have any recollection whatever of me,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;but
      that doesn&rsquo;t make any difference in my sentiment for the place and
      its people. That street out yonder was named for my grandfather: there&rsquo;s
      a statue of my great uncle in the State House yard; all my own blood:
      belonged here, and though I have been a wanderer and may not be remembered&mdash;naturally
      am <i>not</i> remembered&mdash;yet the name is honoured here, and I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      He faltered again, then concluded with quiet earnestness: &ldquo;I thought
      that if my good luck was destined to bring fortunes to others, it might as
      well be to my own kind&mdash;that at least I&rsquo;d offer them the chance
      before I offered it to any one else.&rdquo; He turned and looked Richard
      in the face. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here, Mr. Lindley.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other impulsively put out his hand. &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he
      said heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Corliss changed his tone for one less serious.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve listened very patiently and I hope you&rsquo;ll be
      rewarded for it. Certainly you will if you decide to come in with us. May
      I leave the maps and descriptions with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed. I&rsquo;ll look them over carefully and have another
      talk with you about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heaven, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> over!&rdquo; exclaimed the
      lounger in the hammock, who had not once removed his fascinated stare from
      the expressive face of Valentine Corliss. &ldquo;If you have now concluded
      with dull care, allow me to put a vital question: Mr. Corliss, do you
      sing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman addressed favoured him with a quizzical glance from between
      half-closed lids, and probably checking an impulse to remark that he
      happened to know that his questioner sometimes sang, replied merely,
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; returned the other, inconsequently. &ldquo;It just
      struck me that you ought to sing the Toreador song.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Lindley, placing the notes and maps in his pocket, dropped them,
      and, stooping, began to gather the scattered papers with a very red face.
      Corliss, however, laughed good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s most flattering,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;though there
      are other things in `Carmen&rsquo; I prefer&mdash;probably because one
      doesn&rsquo;t hear them so eternally.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Vilas pulled himself up to a sitting position and began to swing again.
      &ldquo;Observe our host, Mr. Corliss,&rdquo; he commanded gayly. &ldquo;He
      is a kind old Dobbin, much beloved, but cares damn little to hear you or
      me speak of music. He&rsquo;d even rather discuss your oil business than
      listen to us talk of women, whereas nothing except women ever really
      interests <i>you</i>, my dear sir. He&rsquo;s not our kind of man,&rdquo;
      he concluded, mournfully; &ldquo;not at all our kind of man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; Corliss suggested, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s going to be my
      kind of man in the development of these oil-fields.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ridic&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Vilas triumphed over the word after a
      slight struggle&mdash;&ldquo;ulous! I shall review that: ridiculous of you
      to pretend to be interested in oil-fields. You are not that sort of person
      whatever. Nothing could be clearer than that you would never waste the
      time demanded by fields of oil. Groundlings call this `the mechanical age&rsquo;&mdash;a
      vulgar error. My dear sir, you and I know that it is the age of Woman!
      Even poets have begun to see that she is alive. Formerly we did not speak
      of her at all, but of late years she has become such a scandal that she is
      getting talked about. Even our dramas, which used to be all blood, have
      become all flesh. I wish I were dead&mdash;but will continue my harangue
      because the thought is pellucid. Women selecting men to mate with are of
      only two kinds, just as there are but two kinds of children in a toy-shop.
      One child sets its fancy on one partic&rdquo;&mdash;the orator paused,
      then continued&mdash;&ldquo;on one certain toy and will make a distressing
      scene if she doesn&rsquo;t get it: she will have that one; she will go
      straight to it, clasp it and keep it; she won&rsquo;t have any other. The
      other kind of woman is to be understood if you will make the experiment of
      taking the other kind of child to a toy-shop and telling her you will buy
      her any toy in the place, but that you will buy her only one. If you do
      this in the morning, she will still be in the shop when it is closing for
      the night, because, though she runs to each toy in turn with excitement
      and delight, she sees another over her shoulder, and the one she has not
      touched is always her choice&mdash;until she has touched it! Some get
      broken in the handling. For my part, my wires are working rather rustily,
      but I must obey the Stage-Manager. For my requiem I wish somebody would
      ask them to play Gounod&rsquo;s masterpiece.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Corliss, amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`The Funeral March of a Marionette!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean that for a cheerful way of announcing that you
      are a fatalist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fatalism? That is only a word,&rdquo; declared Mr. Vilas gravely.
      &ldquo;If I am not a puppet then I am a god. Somehow, I do not seem to be
      a god. If a god is a god, one thinks he would know it himself. I now yield
      the floor. Thanking you cordially, I believe there is a lady walking
      yonder who commands salutation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet, bowing profoundly. Cora Madison was passing,
      strolling rather briskly down the street, not in the direction of her
      home. She waved her parasol with careless gayety to the trio under the
      trees, and, going on, was lost to their sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; exclaimed Corliss, looking at his watch with a start
      of surprise. &ldquo;I have two letters to write for the evening mail. I
      must be off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, Ray Vilas&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;still fixed upon him, as they had
      been throughout the visit&mdash;opened to their fullest capacity, in a
      gaze of only partially alcoholic wildness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entirely aware of this singular glare, but not in the least disconcerted
      by it, the recipient proffered his easy farewells. &ldquo;I had no idea it
      was so late. Good afternoon. Mr. Vilas, I have been delighted with your
      diagnosis. Lindley, I&rsquo;m at your disposal when you&rsquo;ve looked
      over my data. My very warm thanks for your patience, and&mdash;addio!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lindley looked after him as he strode quickly away across the green lawn,
      turning, at the street, in the direction Cora had taken; and the troubled
      Richard felt his heart sink with vague but miserable apprehension. There
      was a gasp of desperation beside him, and the sound of Ray Vilas&rsquo;s
      lips parting and closing with little noises of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he knows her,&rdquo; said the boy, his thin body shaking.
      &ldquo;Look at him, damn him! See his deep chest, that conqueror&rsquo;s
      walk, the easy, confident, male pride of him: a true-born, natural rake&mdash;the
      Toreador all over!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His agitation passed suddenly; he broke into a loud laugh, and flung a
      reckless hand to his companion&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You good old fool,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll</i>
      never play Don Jose!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER EIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hedrick Madison, like too many other people, had never thought seriously
      about the moon; nor ever had he encouraged it to become his familiar; and
      he underwent his first experience of its incomparable betrayals one
      brilliant night during the last week of that hot month. The preface to
      this romantic evening was substantial and prosaic: four times during
      dinner was he copiously replenished with hash, which occasioned so rich a
      surfeit within him that, upon the conclusion of the meal, he found himself
      in no condition to retort appropriately to a solicitous warning from Cora
      to keep away from the cat. Indeed, it was half an hour later, and he was
      sitting&mdash;to his own consciousness too heavily&mdash;upon the back
      fence, when belated inspiration arrived. But there is no sound where there
      is no ear to hear, and no repartee, alas! when the wretch who said the
      first part has gone, so that Cora remained unscathed as from his alley
      solitude Hedrick hurled in the teeth of the rising moon these bitter
      words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; <i>our</i> cat only eats <i>soft</i> meat!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He renewed a morbid silence, and the moon, with its customary
      deliberation, swung clear of a sweeping branch of the big elm in the front
      yard and shone full upon him. Nothing warned the fated youth not to sit
      there; no shadow of imminent catastrophe tinted that brightness: no angel
      whisper came to him, bidding him begone&mdash;and to go in a hurry and as
      far as possible. No; he sat upon the fence an inoffensive lad, and&mdash;except
      for still feeling his hash somewhat, and a gradually dispersing rancour
      concerning the cat&mdash;at peace. It is for such lulled mortals that the
      ever-lurking Furies save their most hideous surprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chin on palms, he looked idly at the moon, and the moon inscrutably
      returned his stare. Plausible, bright, bland, it gave no sign that it was
      at its awful work. For the bride of night is like a card-dealer whose
      fingers move so swiftly through the pack the trickery goes unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      This moon upon which he was placidly gazing, because he had nothing else
      to do, betokened nought to Hedrick: to him it was the moon of any other
      night, the old moon; certainly no moon of his delight. Withal, it may
      never be gazed upon so fixedly and so protractedly&mdash;no matter how
      languidly&mdash;with entire impunity. That light breeds a bug in the
      brain. Who can deny how the moon wrought this thing under the hair of
      unconscious Hedrick, or doubt its responsibility for the thing that
      happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Little boy</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very soft, small voice, silky and queer; and at first Hedrick had
      little suspicion that it could be addressing him: the most rigid
      self-analysis could have revealed to him no possibility of his fitting so
      ignominious a description.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, little boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked over his shoulder and saw, standing in the alley behind him, a
      girl of about his own age. She was daintily dressed and had beautiful hair
      which was all shining in pale gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was smiling up at him, and once more she used that wantonly inaccurate
      vocative:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick grunted unencouragingly. &ldquo;Who you callin&rsquo; `little boy&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For reply she began to climb the fence. It was high, but the young lady
      was astonishingly agile, and not even to be deterred by several faint
      wails from tearing and ripping fabrics&mdash;casualties which appeared to
      be entirely beneath her notice. Arriving at the top rather dishevelled,
      and with irregular pennons here and there flung to the breeze from her
      attire, she seated herself cosily beside the dumbfounded Hedrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face to him and smiled&mdash;and there was something about
      her smile which Hedrick did not like. It discomforted him; nothing more.
      In sunlight he would have had the better chance to comprehend; but,
      unhappily, this was moonshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me, little boy!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed the shocked and indignant Hedrick,
      edging uneasily away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play,&rdquo; she said cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like chickens. Did you know I like chickens?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rather singular lack of connection in her remarks struck him as a
      misplaced effort at humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re having lots of fun with me, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
      he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She instantly moved close to him and lifted her face to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me, darling little boy!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something more than uncommonly queer about this stranger, an
      unearthliness of which he was confusedly perceptive, but she was not
      without a curious kind of prettiness, and her pale gold hair was
      beautiful. The doomed lad saw the moon shining through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me, darling little boy!&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head whirled; for the moment she seemed divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Washington used profanity at the Battle of Monmouth. Hedrick kissed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He instantly pushed her away with strong distaste. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he
      said angrily. &ldquo;I hope that&rsquo;ll satisfy you!&rdquo; He belonged
      to his sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me some more, darling little boy!&rdquo; she cried, and flung
      her arms about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a smothered shout of dismay he tried to push her off, and they fell
      from the fence together, into the yard, at the cost of further and almost
      fatal injuries to the lady&rsquo;s apparel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick was first upon his feet. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got <i>any</i>
      sense?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled unwaveringly, rose (without assistance) and repeated: &ldquo;Kiss
      me some more, darling little boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t! I wouldn&rsquo;t for a thousand dollars!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently, she did not consider this discouraging. She began to advance
      endearingly, while he retreated backward. &ldquo;Kiss me some&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, I tell you!&rdquo; Hedrick kept stepping away,
      moving in a desperate circle. He resorted to a brutal formula: &ldquo;You
      make me sick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me some more, darling lit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;And if you say that again
      I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me some more, darling little boy!&rdquo; She flung herself at
      him, and with a yell of terror he turned and ran at top-speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pursued, laughing sweetly, and calling loudly as she ran, &ldquo;Kiss
      me some more, darling little boy! Kiss me some more, darling little boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stricken Hedrick knew not whither to direct his flight: he dared not
      dash for the street with this imminent tattered incubus&mdash;she was
      almost upon him&mdash;and he frantically made for the kitchen door, only
      to swerve with a gasp of despair as his foot touched the step, for she was
      at his heels, and he was sickeningly assured she would cheerfully follow
      him through the house, shouting that damning refrain for all ears. A
      strangling fear took him by the throat&mdash;if Cora should come to be a
      spectator of this unspeakable flight, if Cora should hear that horrid plea
      for love! Then farewell peace; indeed, farewell all joy in life forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      Panting sobbingly, he ducked under the amorous vampire&rsquo;s arm and
      fled on. He zigzagged desperately to and fro across the broad, empty
      backyard, a small hand ever and anon managing to clutch his shoulder, the
      awful petition in his ears:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me some more, darling little boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hedrick</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Emerging from the kitchen door, Laura stood and gazed in wonder as the two
      eerie figures sped by her, circled, ducked, dodged, flew madly on. This
      commonplace purlieu was become the scene of a witch-chase; the moonlight
      fell upon the ghastly flitting face of the pursued, uplifted in agony,
      white, wet, with fay eyes; also it illumined the unreal elf following
      close, a breeze-blown fantasy in rags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me some more, darling little boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura uttered a sharp exclamation. &ldquo;Stand still, Hedrick!&rdquo; she
      called. &ldquo;You must!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick made a piteous effort to increase his speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lolita Martin,&rdquo; called Laura. &ldquo;She must have
      her way or nothing can be done with her. Stand <i>still</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick had never heard of Lolita Martin, but the added information
      concerning her was not ineffective: it operated as a spur; and Laura
      joined the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand still!&rdquo; she cried to the wretched quarry. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      run away. She must be taken home. Stop, Hedrick! You <i>must</i> stop!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick had no intention of stopping, but Laura was a runner, and, as he
      dodged the other, caught and held him fast. The next instant, Lolita,
      laughing happily, flung her arms round his neck from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lemme go!&rdquo; shuddered Hedrick. &ldquo;Lemme go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me again, darl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;woof!&rdquo; He became inarticulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t quite right,&rdquo; his sister whispered hurriedly
      in his ear. &ldquo;She has spells when she&rsquo;s weak mentally. You must
      be kind to her. She only wants you to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`<i>Only</i>&rsquo;!&rdquo; he echoed hoarsely. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
      ki&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He was unable to finish the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must get her home,&rdquo; said Laura anxiously. &ldquo;Will you
      come with me, Lolita, dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently Lolita had no consciousness whatever of Laura&rsquo;s presence.
      Instead of replying, she tightened her grasp upon Hedrick and warmly
      reiterated her request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, you parrot!&rdquo; hissed the goaded boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;ll go if you let her walk with her arms round
      your neck,&rdquo; suggested Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I <i>what</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try it. We&rsquo;ve got to get her home; her mother
      must be frantic about her. Come, let&rsquo;s see if she&rsquo;ll go with
      us that way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With convincing earnestness, Hedrick refused to make the experiment until
      Laura suggested that he remain with Lolita while she summoned assistance;
      then, as no alternative appeared, his spirit broke utterly, and he
      consented to the trial, stipulating with a last burst of vehemence that
      the progress of the unthinkable pageant should be through the alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Lolita,&rdquo; said Laura coaxingly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going
      for a nice walk.&rdquo; At the adjective, Hedrick&rsquo;s burdened
      shoulders were racked with a brief spasm, which recurred as his sister
      added: &ldquo;Your darling little boy will let you keep hold of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lolita seemed content. Laughing gayly, she offered no opposition, but,
      maintaining her embrace with both arms and walking somewhat sidewise, went
      willingly enough; and the three slowly crossed the yard, passed through
      the empty stable and out into the alley. When they reached the
      cross-street at the alley&rsquo;s upper end, Hedrick balked flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura expostulated, then entreated. Hedrick refused with sincere loathing
      to be seen upon the street occupying his present position in the group.
      Laura assured him that there was no one to see; he replied that the moon
      was bright and the evening early; he would die, and readily, but he would
      not set foot in the street. Unfortunately, he had selected an unfavourable
      spot for argument: they were already within a yard or two of the street;
      and a strange boy, passing, stopped and observed, and whistled
      discourteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he the spooner!&rdquo; remarked this unknown with
      hideous admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thank you,&rdquo; returned Hedrick haughtily, &ldquo;to
      go on about your own business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me some more, darling little boy!&rdquo; said Lolita.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange boy squawked, wailed, screamed with laughter, howled the
      loving petition in a dozen keys of mockery, while Hedrick writhed and
      Lolita clung. Enriched by a new and great experience, the torturer trotted
      on, leaving viperish cachinnations in his wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the martyrdom was at an end. A woman, hurrying past, bareheaded, was
      greeted by a cry of delight from Lolita, who released Hedrick and ran to
      her with outstretched arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were bringing her home, Mrs. Martin,&rdquo; said Laura,
      reassuringly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right; nothing&rsquo;s the matter
      except that her dress got torn. We found her playing in our yard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you a thousand times, Miss Madison,&rdquo; cried Lolita&rsquo;s
      mother, and flutteringly plunged into a description of her anxiety, her
      search for Lolita, and concluded with renewed expressions of gratitude for
      the child&rsquo;s safe return, an outpouring of thankfulness and joy
      wholly incomprehensible to Hedrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Laura cheerfully. &ldquo;Come, Hedrick. We&rsquo;ll
      go home by the street, I think.&rdquo; She touched his shoulder, and he
      went with her in stunned obedience. He was not able to face the incredible
      thing that had happened to him: he walked in a trance of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little girl!&rdquo; said Laura gently, with what seemed to her
      brother an indefensibly misplaced compassion. &ldquo;Usually they have her
      live in an institution for people afflicted as she is, but they brought
      her home for a visit last week, I believe. Of course you didn&rsquo;t
      understand, but I think you should have been more thoughtful. Really, you
      shouldn&rsquo;t have flirted with her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`<i>Flirted</i>&rsquo;!&rdquo; His voice was beginning to show
      symptoms of changing, this year; it rose to a falsetto wail, flickered and
      went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the departure of Lolita in safety, what had seemed bizarre and
      piteous became obscured, and another aspect of the adventure was presented
      to Laura. The sufferings of the arrogant are not wholly depressing to the
      spectator; and of arrogance Hedrick had ever been a master. She began to
      shake; a convulsion took her, and suddenly she sat upon the curbstone
      without dignity, and laughed as he had never seen her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A horrid distrust of her rose within him: he began to realize in what
      plight he stood, what terrors o&rsquo;erhung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said miserably, &ldquo;are you&mdash;you aren&rsquo;t&mdash;you
      don&rsquo;t have to go and&mdash;and <i>talk</i> about this, do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Hedrick,&rdquo; she responded, rising and controlling herself
      somewhat. &ldquo;Not so long as you&rsquo;re good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was no reassuring answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And politer to Cora,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seemingly he heard the lash of a slave-whip crack in the air. The future
      grew dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ll try&rdquo;&mdash;she said; and the unhappy lad
      felt that her assurance was justified; but she had not concluded the
      sentence&mdash;&ldquo;darling little boy,&rdquo; she capped it, choking
      slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other little girl ever fell in love with you, did there,
      Hedrick?&rdquo; she asked, and, receiving an incoherent but furious reply,
      she was again overcome, so that she must lean against the fence to
      recover. &ldquo;It seems&mdash;so&mdash;so <i>curious</i>,&rdquo; she
      explained, gasping, &ldquo;that the first one&mdash;the&mdash;the only one&mdash;should
      be an&mdash;a&mdash;an&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She was unable to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick&rsquo;s distrust became painfully increased: he began to feel that
      he disliked Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still wiping her eyes and subject to recurrent outbursts when they
      reached their own abode; and as he bitterly flung himself into a chair
      upon the vacant front porch, he heard her stifling an attack as she
      mounted the stairs to her own room. He swung the chair about, with its
      back to the street, and sat facing the wall. He saw nothing. There are
      profundities in the abyss which reveal no glimpse of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he heard his father coughing near by; and the sound was hateful,
      because it seemed secure and unshamed. It was a cough of moral
      superiority; and just then the son would have liked to believe that his
      parent&rsquo;s boyhood had been one of degradation as complete as his own;
      but no one with this comfortable cough could ever have plumbed such
      depths: his imagination refused the picture he was bitterly certain that
      Mr. Madison had never kissed an idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick had a dread that his father might speak to him; he was in no
      condition for light conversation. But Mr. Madison was unaware of his son&rsquo;s
      near presence, and continued upon his purposeless way. He was smoking his
      one nightly cigar and enjoying the moonlight. He drifted out toward the
      sidewalk and was accosted by a passing acquaintance, a comfortable burgess
      of sixty, leading a child of six or seven, by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out taking the air, are you, Mr. Madison?&rdquo; said the
      pedestrian, pausing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; just trying to cool off,&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;How
      are you, Pryor, anyway? I haven&rsquo;t seen you for a long time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not since last summer,&rdquo; said Pryor. &ldquo;I only get here
      once or twice a year, to see my married daughter. I always try to spend
      August with her if I can. She&rsquo;s still living in that little house,
      over on the next street, I bought for her through your real-estate
      company. I suppose you&rsquo;re still in the same business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Pretty slack, these days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so, I suppose so,&rdquo; responded Mr. Pryor, nodding.
      &ldquo;Summer, I suppose it usually is. Well, I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll
      be going out on the road again myself. Business is pretty slack all over
      the country this year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;I&rsquo;ve forgotten,&rdquo; said Madison
      ruminatively. &ldquo;You travel, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a New York house,&rdquo; affirmed Mr. Pryor. He did not,
      however, mention his &ldquo;line.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes-sir,&rdquo; he added,
      merely as a decoration, and then said briskly: &ldquo;I see you have a
      fine family, Mr. Madison; yes-sir, a fine family; I&rsquo;ve passed here
      several times lately and I&rsquo;ve noticed &rsquo;em: fine family. Let&rsquo;s
      see, you&rsquo;ve got four, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;Two girls and a boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, that&rsquo;s mighty nice,&rdquo; observed Mr. Pryor;
      &ldquo;<i>mighty</i> nice! I only have my one daughter, and of course me
      living in New York when I&rsquo;m at home, and her here, why, I don&rsquo;t
      get to see much of her. You got both your daughters living with you, haven&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, right here at home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see: neither of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s married, I believe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me now,&rdquo; said Pryor, taking off his glasses and
      wiping them, &ldquo;seems to me I did hear somebody say one of &rsquo;em
      was going to be married engaged, maybe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose you&rsquo;d be the first to know! Yes-sir.&rdquo;
      And both men laughed their appreciation of this folly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      mighty good-looking girls, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> certain,&rdquo; continued
      Mr. Pryor. &ldquo;And one of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s as fine a dresser as you&rsquo;ll
      meet this side the Rue de la Paix.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean in Paris?&rdquo; asked Madison, slightly surprised at this
      allusion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been over there, Pryor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sometimes,&rdquo; was the response. &ldquo;My business takes me
      over, now and then. I <i>think</i> it&rsquo;s one of your daughters I&rsquo;ve
      noticed dresses so well. Isn&rsquo;t one of &rsquo;em a mighty pretty girl
      about twenty-one or two, with a fine head of hair sort of lightish brown,
      beautiful figure, and carries a white parasol with a green lining
      sometimes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s Cora, I guess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty name, too,&rdquo; said Pryor approvingly. &ldquo;Yes-sir. I
      saw her going into a florist&rsquo;s, downtown, the other day, with a
      fine-looking young fellow&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think of his name. Let&rsquo;s
      see: my daughter was with me, and she&rsquo;d heard his name&mdash;said
      his family used to be big people in this town and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Madison, &ldquo;young Corliss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corliss!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pryor, with satisfaction. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      it, Corliss. Well, sir,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;from the way he was
      looking at your Miss Cora it struck me he seemed kind of anxious for her
      name to be Corliss, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hardly I expect,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;They just
      barely know each other: he&rsquo;s only been here a few weeks; they haven&rsquo;t
      had time to get much acquainted, you see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Pryor, with perfect readiness.
      &ldquo;I suppose not. I&rsquo;ll bet <i>he</i> tries all he can to get
      acquainted though; he looked pretty smart to me. Doesn&rsquo;t he come
      about as often as the law allows?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised,&rdquo; said Madison indifferently.
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know many people about here any more, and it&rsquo;s
      lonesome for him at the hotel. But I guess he comes to see the whole
      family; I left him in the library a little while ago, talking to my wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way! Get around the old folks first!&rdquo; Mr.
      Pryor chuckled cordially; then in a mildly inquisitive tone he said:
      &ldquo;Seems to be a fine, square young fellow, I expect?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty name, `Cora&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Pryor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this little girl&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; Mr. Madison
      indicated the child, who had stood with heroic patience throughout the
      incomprehensible dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lottie, for her mother. She&rsquo;s a good little girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is <i>so</i>! I&rsquo;ve got a young son she ought to know,&rdquo;
      remarked Mr. Madison serenely, with an elderly father&rsquo;s total
      unconsciousness of the bridgeless gap between seven and thirteen. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d
      like to play with her. I&rsquo;ll call him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect we better be getting on,&rdquo; said Pryor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      near Lottie&rsquo;s bedtime; we just came out for our evening walk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he can come and shake hands with her anyway,&rdquo; urged
      Hedrick&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll know each other, and
      they can play some other time.&rdquo; He turned toward the house and
      called loudly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hedrick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no response. Behind the back of his chair Hedrick could not be
      seen. He was still sitting immovable, his eyes torpidly fixed upon the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hed-<i>rick</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>Hed</i>-rick!&rdquo; shouted his father. &ldquo;Come out
      here! I want you to meet a little girl! Come and see a nice little girl!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pryor&rsquo;s grandchild was denied the pleasure. At the ghastly words
      &ldquo;<i>little girl</i>,&rdquo; Hedrick dropped from his chair flat upon
      the floor, crawled to the end of the porch, wriggled through the railing,
      and immersed himself in deep shadow against the side of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he removed his shoes, noiselessly mounted to the sill of one of the
      library windows, then reconnoitred through a slit in the blinds before
      entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gas burned low in the &ldquo;drop-light&rdquo;&mdash;almost too dimly
      to reveal the two people upon a sofa across the room. It was a faint
      murmur from one of them that caused Hedrick to pause and peer more
      sharply. They were Cora and Corliss; he was bending close to her; her face
      was lifting to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, kiss me! Kiss me!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick dropped from the sill, climbed through a window of the kitchen,
      hurried up the back-stairs, and reached his own apartment in time to be
      violently ill in seclusion.

      CHAPTER NINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Villages are scattered plentifully over the unstable buttresses of
      Vesuvius, and the inhabitants sleep o&rsquo; nights: Why not? Quite
      unaware that he was much of their condition, Mr. Madison bade his
      incidental gossip and the tiny Lottie good-night, and sought his early
      bed. He maintained in good faith that Saturday night was &ldquo;a great
      night to sleep,&rdquo; because of the later hour for rising; probably
      having also some factitious conviction that there prevailed a hush
      preparative of the Sabbath. As a matter of fact, in summer, the other
      members of his family always looked uncommonly haggard at the Sunday
      breakfast-table. Accepting without question his preposterous legend of
      additional matutinal slumber, they postponed retiring to a late hour, and
      were awakened&mdash;simultaneously with thousands of fellow-sufferers&mdash;at
      about half-after five on Sunday morning, by a journalistic uprising. Over
      the town, in these early hours, rampaged the small vendors of the manifold
      sheets: local papers and papers from greater cities, hawker succeeding
      hawker with yell upon yell and brain-piercing shrillings in unbearable
      cadences. No good burgher ever complained: the people bore it, as in
      winter they bore the smoke that injured their health, ruined their linen,
      spoiled their complexions, forbade all hope of beauty and comfort in their
      city, and destroyed the sweetness of their homes and of their wives. It is
      an incredibly patient citizenry and exalts its persecutors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the Madison family, Cora probably suffered most; and this was the time
      when it was no advantage to have the front bedroom. She had not slept
      until close upon dawn, and the hawkers woke her irreparably; she could but
      rage upon her hot pillow. By and by, there came a token that another
      anguish kept company with hers. She had left her door open for a better
      circulation of the warm and languid air, and from Hedrick&rsquo;s room
      issued an &ldquo;<i>oof</i>!&rdquo; of agonized disgust. Cora little
      suspected that the youth reeked not of newsboys: Hedrick&rsquo;s miseries
      were introspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cries from the street were interminable; each howler in turn heard
      faintly in the distance, then in crescendo until he had passed and another
      succeeded him, and all the while Cora lay tossing and whispering between
      clenched teeth. Having ample reason, that morning, to prefer sleep to
      thinking, sleep was impossible. But she fought for it: she did not easily
      surrender what she wanted; and she struggled on, with closed eyes, long
      after she had heard the others go down to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a hundred yards from her windows, to the rear, were the open windows
      of a church which fronted the next street, and stood dos-a-dos to the
      dwelling of the Madisons. The Sunday-school hour had been advanced for the
      hot weather, and, partly on this account, and partly because of the summer
      absence of many families, the attendants were few. But the young voices
      were conducted, rather than accompanied, in pious melody by a cornetist
      who worthily thought to amend, in his single person, what lack of volume
      this paucity occasioned. He was a slender young man in hot black clothes;
      he wore the unfacaded collar fatally and unanimously adopted by all adam&rsquo;s-apple
      men of morals; he was washed, fair, flat-skulled, clean-minded, and
      industrious; and the only noise of any kind he ever made in the world was
      on Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prashus joowuls, sweet joowuls, <i>thee</i> jams off iz crowowun,&rdquo;
      sang the little voices feebly. They were almost unheard; but the young man
      helped them out: figuratively, he put them out. And the cornet was heard:
      it was heard for blocks and blocks; it was heard over all that part of the
      town&mdash;in the vicinity of the church it was the only thing that could
      be heard. In his daily walk this cornetist had no enemies: he was
      kind-hearted; he would not have shot a mad dog; he gladly nursed the sick.
      He sat upon the platform before the children; he swelled, perspired and
      blew, and felt that it was a good blowing. If other thoughts vapoured upon
      the borders of his mind, they were of the dinner he would eat, soon after
      noon, at the house of one of the frilled, white-muslin teachers. He was
      serene. His eyes were not blasted; his heart was not instantly withered;
      his thin, bluish hair did not fall from his head; his limbs were not
      detached from his torso&mdash;yet these misfortunes had been desired for
      him, with comprehension and sincerity, at the first flat blat of his
      brassy horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to imagine the state of mind of this young cornetist,
      could he have known that he had caused the prettiest girl in town to jump
      violently out of bed with what petitions upon her lips regarding his
      present whereabouts and future detention! It happened that during the
      course of his Sunday walk on Corliss Street, that very afternoon, he saw
      her&mdash;was hard-smitten by her beauty, and for weeks thereafter laid
      unsuccessful plans to &ldquo;meet&rdquo; her. Her image was imprinted: he
      talked about her to his boarding-house friends and office acquaintances,
      his favourite description being, &ldquo;the sweetest-looking lady I ever
      laid eyes on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora, descending to the breakfast-table rather white herself, was not
      unpleasantly shocked by the haggard aspect of Hedrick, who, with Laura and
      Mrs. Madison, still lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Cora,&rdquo; he said politely, and while she stared,
      in suspicious surprise, he passed her a plate of toast with ostentatious
      courtesy; but before she could take one of the slices, &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;
      he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very nice toast, but I&rsquo;m afraid it isn&rsquo;t
      hot. I&rsquo;ll take it to the kitchen and have it warmed for you.&rdquo;
      And he took the plate and went out, walking softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora turned to her mother, appalled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be sick!&rdquo;
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Madison shook her head and smiled sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He helped to wait on all of us: he must have been doing something
      awful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More likely he wants permission to do something awful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Cora,&rdquo; said Hedrick kindly, when he brought the toast;
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find that nice and hot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him steadfastly, but with modesty he avoided her eye. &ldquo;You
      wouldn&rsquo;t make such a radical change in your nature, Hedrick,&rdquo;
      she said, with a puzzled frown, &ldquo;just to get out of going to church,
      would you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get out of going to church,&rdquo; he said.
      He gulped slightly. &ldquo;I like church.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And church-time found him marching decorously beside his father, the three
      ladies forming a rear rank; a small company in the very thin procession of
      fanning women and mopping men whose destination was the gray stone church
      at the foot of Corliss Street. The locusts railed overhead: Hedrick looked
      neither to the right nor to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed a club, of which a lower window was vacated simultaneously
      with their coming into view; and a small but ornate figure in pale gray
      crash hurried down the steps and attached itself to the second row of
      Madisons. &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; said Mr. Wade Trumble. &ldquo;Thought
      I&rsquo;d take a look-in at church this morning myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Care of this encumbrance was usually expected of Laura and Mrs. Madison,
      but to their surprise Cora offered a sprightly rejoinder and presently
      dropped behind them with Mr. Trumble. Mr. Trumble was also surprised and,
      as naively, pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; he asked with cheerful frankness.
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t given me a chance to talk to you for a long
      while.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she smiled enigmatically. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think you&rsquo;ve tried very hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too careless; it did not quite serve, even for Trumble. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      up?&rdquo; he asked, not without shrewdness. &ldquo;Is Richard Lindley out
      of town?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Perhaps it&rsquo;s this new chap, Corliss? Has he left?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense! What have they got to do with my being nice to you?&rdquo;
      She gave him a dangerous smile, and it wrought upon him visibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever be nice to me unless you mean it,&rdquo; he
      said feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora looked grave and sweet; she seemed mysteriously moved. &ldquo;I never
      do anything I don&rsquo;t mean,&rdquo; she said in a low voice which
      thrilled the little man. This was machine-work, easy and accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed, shifting on the instant to a lively
      brusqueness. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for you just <i>now</i>. We&rsquo;re
      on our way to church!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Trumble felt almost that she had accepted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got your penny for the contribution box?&rdquo; she
      smiled. &ldquo;I suppose you really give a great deal to the church. I
      hear you&rsquo;re richer and richer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do pretty well,&rdquo; he returned, coolly. &ldquo;You can know
      just how well, if you like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on Sunday,&rdquo; she laughed; then went on, admiringly,
      &ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;re very dashing in your speculations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve heard wrong, because I don&rsquo;t speculate,&rdquo;
      he returned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a gambler&mdash;except on certainties. I
      guess I disappointed a friend of yours the other day because I wouldn&rsquo;t
      back him on a thousand-to-one shot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; she asked, with an expression entirely veiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corliss. He came to see me; wanted me to put real money into an oil
      scheme. Too thin!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it `too thin&rsquo;?&rdquo; she asked carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too far away, for one thing&mdash;somewhere in Italy. Anybody who
      put up his cash would have to do it on Corliss&rsquo;s bare word that he&rsquo;s
      struck oil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; She turned her face to him, and a faint perturbation
      was manifest in her tone. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Mr. Corliss&rsquo;s `bare
      word&rsquo; supposed to be perfectly good?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I suppose so, but I don&rsquo;t know. He isn&rsquo;t known
      here: nobody really knows anything about him except that he was born here.
      Besides, I wouldn&rsquo;t make an investment on my own father&rsquo;s bare
      word, if he happened to be alive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not!&rdquo; Cora spoke impulsively, a sudden anger getting
      the better of her, but she controlled it immediately. &ldquo;Of course I
      don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; she laughed, sweetly. &ldquo;But <i>I</i>
      happen to think Mr. Corliss&rsquo;s scheme a very handsome one, and I want
      my friends to make their fortunes, of course. Richard Lindley and papa are
      going into it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Trumble promptly.
      &ldquo;Lindley told me he&rsquo;d looked it over and couldn&rsquo;t see
      his way to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did?&rdquo; Cora stiffened perceptibly and bit her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trumble began to laugh. &ldquo;This is funny: you trying to talk business!
      So Corliss has been telling you about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has; and I understand it perfectly. I think there&rsquo;s
      an enormous fortune in it, and you&rsquo;d better not laugh at me: a woman&rsquo;s
      instinct about such things is better than a man&rsquo;s experience
      sometimes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find neither Lindley nor your father are going to
      think so,&rdquo; he returned skeptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a deep, sweet look. &ldquo;But I mustn&rsquo;t be
      disappointed in you,&rdquo; she said, with the suggestion of a tremor in
      her voice, &ldquo;whatever <i>they</i> do! You&rsquo;ll take my advice,
      won&rsquo;t you&mdash;Wade?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your advice in anything but business.&rdquo; He
      shook his head ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t you take my advice in business,&rdquo;&mdash;she
      asked very slowly and significantly&mdash;&ldquo;under <i>any</i>
      circumstances?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he said huskily, &ldquo;if you were my wife?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked away, and slightly inclined her head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
      answered doggedly, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t. You know mighty well that&rsquo;s
      what I want you to be, and I&rsquo;d give my soul for the tip of your
      shoe, but business is an entirely different matter, and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Wade</i>!&rdquo; she said, with wonderful and thrilling
      sweetness. They had reached the church; Hedrick and his father had
      entered; Mrs. Madison and Laura were waiting on the steps. Cora and
      Trumble came to a stop some yards away. &ldquo;Wade, I&mdash;I <i>want</i>
      you to go into this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; he said stubbornly. &ldquo;If you ever
      make up your mind to marry me, I&rsquo;ll spend all the money you like on
      <i>you</i>, but you&rsquo;ll have to keep to the woman&rsquo;s side of the
      house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make it pretty hard for me to be nice to you,&rdquo; she
      returned, and the tremor now more evident in her voice was perfectly
      genuine. &ldquo;You positively refuse to do this&mdash;for me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I do. I wouldn&rsquo;t buy sight-unseen to please God &lsquo;lmighty,
      Cora Madison.&rdquo; He looked at her shrewdly, struck by a sudden
      thought. &ldquo;Did Corliss ask you to try and get me in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not,&rdquo; she responded, icily. &ldquo;Your refusal is
      final?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; He struck the pavement a smart rap with his
      walking-stick. &ldquo;By George, I believe he <i>did</i> ask you! That
      spoils church for me this morning; I&rsquo;ll not go in. When you quit
      playing games, let me know. You needn&rsquo;t try to work me any more,
      because I won&rsquo;t stand for it, but if you ever get tired of playing,
      come and tell me so.&rdquo; He uttered a bark of rueful laughter. &ldquo;Ha!
      I must say that gentleman has an interesting way of combining business
      with pleasure!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Under favourable circumstances the blow Cora dealt him might have been
      physically more violent. &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; she laughed, gayly.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bothering much about Mr. Corliss&rsquo;s oil in
      Italy. I had a bet with Laura I could keep you from saying `I beg to
      differ,&rsquo; or talking about the weather for five minutes. She&rsquo;ll
      have to pay me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, still laughing, she lowered her parasol, and with superb impudence,
      brushed it smartly across his face; turned on her heel, and, red with
      fury, joined her mother and sister, and went into the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service failed to occupy her attention: she had much in her thoughts
      to distract her. Nevertheless, she bestowed some wonderment upon the
      devotion with which her brother observed each ceremonial rite. He joined
      in prayer with real fervour; he sang earnestly and loudly; a great appeal
      sounded in his changing voice; and during the sermon he sat with his eyes
      upon the minister in a stricken fixity. All this was so remarkable that
      Cora could not choose but ponder upon it, and, observing Hedrick
      furtively, she caught, if not a clue itself, at least a glimpse of one.
      She saw Laura&rsquo;s clear profile becoming subtly agitated; then noticed
      a shimmer of Laura&rsquo;s dark eye as it wandered to Hedrick and so
      swiftly away it seemed not to dare to remain. Cora was quick: she
      perceived that Laura was repressing a constant desire to laugh and that
      she feared to look at Hedrick lest it overwhelm her. So Laura knew what
      had wrought the miracle. Cora made up her mind to explore this secret
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the service was over and the people were placidly buzzing their way
      up the aisles, Cora felt herself drawn to look across the church, and
      following the telepathic impulse, turned her head to encounter the gaze of
      Ray Vilas. He was ascending the opposite aisle, walking beside Richard
      Lindley. He looked less pale than usual, though his thinness was so
      extreme it was like emaciation; but his eyes were clear and quiet, and the
      look he gave her was strangely gentle. Cora frowned and turned away her
      head with an air of annoyance. They came near each other in the
      convergence at the doors; but he made no effort to address her, and,
      moving away through the crowd as quickly as possible, disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine Corliss was disclosed in the vestibule. He reached her an
      instant in advance of Mr. Lindley, who had suffered himself to be impeded;
      and Cora quickly handed the former her parasol, lightly taking his arm.
      Thus the slow Richard found himself walking beside Laura in a scattered
      group, its detached portion consisting of his near-betrothed and Corliss;
      for although the dexterous pair were first to leave the church, they
      contrived to be passed almost at once, and, assuming the position of
      trailers, lagged far behind on the homeward way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura and Richard walked in the unmitigated glare of the sun; he had taken
      her black umbrella and conscientiously held it aloft, but over nobody.
      They walked in silence: they were quiet people, both of them; and Richard,
      not &ldquo;talkative&rdquo; under any circumstances, never had anything
      whatever to say to Laura Madison. He had known her for many years, ever
      since her childhood; seldom indeed formulating or expressing a definite
      thought about her, though sometimes it was vaguely of his consciousness
      that she played the piano nicely, and even then her music had taken its
      place as but a colour of Cora&rsquo;s background. For to him, as to every
      one else (including Laura), Laura was in nothing her sister&rsquo;s
      competitor. She was a neutral-tinted figure, taken-for-granted, obscured,
      and so near being nobody at all, that, as Richard Lindley walked beside
      her this morning, he glanced back at the lagging couple and uttered a long
      and almost sonorous sigh, which he would have been ashamed for anybody to
      hear; and then actually proceeded on his way without the slightest
      realization that anybody had heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood. And she did not disturb the trance; she did nothing to
      make him observe that she was there. She walked on with head, shoulders,
      and back scorching in the fierce sun, and allowed him to continue shading
      the pavement before them with her umbrella. When they reached the house
      she gently took the umbrella from him and thanked him; and he mechanically
      raised his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had walked more than a mile together; he had not spoken a word, and
      he did not even know it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dinner on Sunday, the most elaborate feast of the week for the Madisons,
      was always set for one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and sometimes began
      before two, but not to-day: the escorts of both daughters remained, and a
      change of costume by Cora occasioned a long postponement. Justice demands
      the admission that her reappearance in a glamour of lilac was reward for
      the delay; nothing more ravishing was ever seen, she was warrantably
      informed by the quicker of the two guests, in a moment&rsquo;s whispered
      tete-a-tete across the banisters as she descended. Another wait followed
      while she prettily arranged upon the table some dozens of asters from a
      small garden-bed, tilled, planted, and tended by Laura. Meanwhile, Mrs.
      Madison constantly turned the other cheek to the cook. Laura assisted in
      the pacification; Hedrick froze the ice-cream to an impenetrable solidity;
      and the nominal head of the family sat upon the front porch with the two
      young men, and wiped his wrists and rambled politically till they were
      summoned to the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora did the talking for the table. She was in high spirits; no trace
      remained of a haggard night: there was a bloom upon her&mdash;she was
      radiant. Her gayety may have had some inspiration in her daring, for round
      her throat she wore a miraculously slender chain of gold and enamel, with
      a pendant of minute pale sapphires scrolled about a rather large and very
      white diamond. Laura started when she saw it, and involuntarily threw a
      glance almost of terror at Richard Lindley. But that melancholy and
      absent-minded gentleman observed neither the glance nor the jewel. He saw
      Cora&rsquo;s eyes, when they were vouchsafed to his vision, and when they
      were not he apparently saw nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the general exodus from the table, Cora asked Laura to come to the
      piano and play, a request which brought a snort from Hedrick, who was
      taken off his guard. Catching Laura&rsquo;s eye, he applied a handkerchief
      with renewed presence of mind, affecting to have sneezed, and stared
      searchingly over it at Corliss. He perceived that the man remained
      unmoved, evidently already informed that it was Laura who was the
      musician. Cora must be going it pretty fast this time: such was the form
      of her brother&rsquo;s deduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Laura opened the piano, Richard had taken a seat beside Cora, and
      Corliss stood leaning in the doorway. The player lost herself in a
      wandering medley, echoes from &ldquo;Boheme&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pagliacci&rdquo;;
      then drifted into improvisation and played her heart into it magnificently&mdash;a
      heart released to happiness. The still air of the room filled with
      wonderful, golden sound: a song like the song of a mother flying from
      earth to a child in the stars, a torrential tenderness, unpent and
      glorying in freedom. The flooding, triumphant chords rose, crashed&mdash;stopped
      with a shattering abruptness. Laura&rsquo;s hands fell to her sides, then
      were raised to her glowing face and concealed it for a moment. She
      shivered; a quick, deep sigh heaved her breast; and she came back to
      herself like a prisoner leaving a window at the warden&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned. Cora and Corliss had left the room. Richard was sitting beside
      a vacant chair, staring helplessly at the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had been vaguely conscious of Laura&rsquo;s playing, which is
      possible, certainly he was unaware that it had ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The others have gone out to the porch,&rdquo; she said composedly,
      and rose. &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t we join them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he returned, blankly. &ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out on the porch with the others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He got to his feet confusedly. &ldquo;I
      was thinking&mdash;&mdash; I believe I&rsquo;d best be going home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not `best,&rsquo; I think,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not even better!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; he said, his perplexity only increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Corliss would,&rdquo; she retorted quickly. &ldquo;Come on: we&rsquo;ll
      go and sit with them.&rdquo; And she compelled his obedience by preceding
      him with such a confident assumption that he would follow that he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fugitive pair were not upon the porch, however; they were discovered
      in the shade of a tree behind the house, seated upon a rug, and occupied
      in a conversation which would not have disturbed a sick-room. The pursuers
      came upon them, boldly sat beside them; and Laura began to talk with
      unwonted fluency to Corliss, but within five minutes found herself alone
      with Richard Lindley upon the rug. Cora had promised to show Mr. Corliss
      an &ldquo;old print&rdquo; in the library&mdash;so Cora said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lindley gave the remaining lady a desolate and faintly reproachful look.
      He was kind, but he was a man; and Laura saw that this last abandonment
      was being attributed in part to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reddened, and, being not an angel, observed with crispness: &ldquo;Certainly.
      You&rsquo;re quite right: it&rsquo;s my fault!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; he asked vacantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him rather fixedly; his own gaze had returned to the angle
      of the house beyond which the other couple had just disappeared. &ldquo;I
      said,&rdquo; she answered, slowly, &ldquo;I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t rain
      this, afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His wistful eyes absently swept the serene sky which had been cloudless
      for several days. &ldquo;No, I suppose not,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; she said with a little sharpness, &ldquo;will you
      please listen to me for a moment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;what?&rdquo; He was like a diver coming up out of deep
      water. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; He laughed apologetically. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t
      I listening? I beg your pardon. What is it, Laura?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you let Mr. Corliss take Cora away from you like that?&rdquo;
      she asked gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the young man returned with a rueful shake
      of the head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see? It&rsquo;s Cora that goes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you let her, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to be able to keep up with Cora,
      especially when she&rsquo;s punishing me. I couldn&rsquo;t do something
      she asked me to, last night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Invest with Mr. Corliss?&rdquo; asked Laura quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It seemed to trouble her that I couldn&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s
      convinced it&rsquo;s a good thing: she thinks it would make a great
      fortune for us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`Us&rsquo;?&rdquo; repeated Laura gently. &ldquo;You mean for you
      and her? When you&rsquo;re&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we&rsquo;re married. Yes,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      the way she stated it. She wanted me to put in all I have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; said Laura decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her with sharp inquiry. &ldquo;Do you mean you would
      distrust Mr. Corliss?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of that: I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;d
      trust him or not&mdash;I think I wouldn&rsquo;t; there&rsquo;s something
      veiled about him, and I don&rsquo;t believe he is an easy man to know.
      What I meant was that I don&rsquo;t believe it would really be a good
      thing for you with Cora.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would please her, of course&mdash;thinking I deferred so much to
      her judgment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; she said again, impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can,&rdquo; he returned sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my work for all the years since I got out of college,
      and if I lost it I&rsquo;d have to begin all over again. It would mean
      postponing everything. Cora isn&rsquo;t a girl you can ask to share a
      little salary, and if it were a question of years, perhaps&mdash; perhaps
      Cora might not feel she could wait for me, you see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made this explanation with plaintive and boyish sincerity,
      hesitatingly, and as if pleading a cause. And Laura, after a long look at
      him, turned away, and in her eyes were actual tears of compassion for the
      incredible simpleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps she might not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s fond of having
      nice things, and she thinks this is a great chance for us to be
      millionaires; and then, too, I think she may feel that it would please Mr.
      Corliss and help to save him from disappointment. She seems to have taken
      a great fancy to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura glanced at him, but did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He <i>is</i> attractive,&rdquo; continued Richard feebly. &ldquo;I
      think he has a great deal of what people call `magnetism&rsquo;: he&rsquo;s
      the kind of man who somehow makes you want to do what he wants you to. He
      seems a manly, straightforward sort, too&mdash;so far as one can tell&mdash;and
      when he came to me with his scheme I was strongly inclined to go into it.
      But it is too big a gamble, and I can&rsquo;t, though I was sorry to
      disappoint him myself. He was perfectly cheerful about it and so pleasant
      it made me feel small. I don&rsquo;t wonder at all that Cora likes him so
      much. Besides, he seems to understand her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura looked very grave. &ldquo;I think he does,&rdquo; she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then he&rsquo;s `different,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      more a `man of the world&rsquo; than most of us here: she never saw
      anything just like him before, and she&rsquo;s seen <i>us</i> all her
      life. She likes change, of course. That&rsquo;s natural,&rdquo; he said
      gently. &ldquo;Poor Vilas says she wants a man to be different every day,
      and if he isn&rsquo;t, then she wants a different man every day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve rather taken Ray Vilas under your wing, haven&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo; asked Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he answered deprecatingly. &ldquo;I only try to keep
      him with me so he&rsquo;ll stay away from downtown as much as possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he talk much of Cora?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the time. There&rsquo;s no stopping him. I suppose he can&rsquo;t
      help it, because he thinks of nothing else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather&mdash;rather queer for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`Queer&rsquo;?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose not!&rdquo; She laughed impatiently. &ldquo;And
      probably you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s `queer&rsquo; of you to sit here
      helplessly, and let another man take your place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t `let&rsquo; him, Laura,&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he just does it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;you must admit my efforts to
      supplant him haven&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take any effort now,&rdquo; she said, rising
      quickly. Valentine Corliss came into their view upon the sidewalk in
      front, taking his departure. Seeing that they observed him, he lifted his
      hat to Laura and nodded a cordial good-day to Lindley. Then he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before he reached the corner of the lot, he encountered upon the
      pavement a citizen of elderly and plain appearance, strolling with a
      grandchild. The two men met and passed, each upon his opposite way,
      without pausing and without salutation, and neither Richard nor Laura,
      whose eyes were upon the meeting, perceived that they had taken cognizance
      of each other. But one had asked a question and the other had answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pryor spoke in a low monotone, with a rapidity as singular as the
      restrained but perceptible emphasis he put upon one word of his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got you in the park,&rdquo; he said; and it is to be deduced that
      &ldquo;got&rdquo; was argot. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not <i>doing</i> anything
      here, are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; answered Corliss with condensed venom, his back already
      to the other. He fanned himself with his hat as he went on. Mr. Pryor
      strolled up the street with imperturbable benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your coast is cleared,&rdquo; said Laura, &ldquo;since you wouldn&rsquo;t
      clear it yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish me luck,&rdquo; said Richard as he left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he disappeared, he looked back to her again (which profoundly
      surprised her) and smiled rather disconsolately, shaking his head as in
      prophecy of no very encouraging reception indoors. The manner of this
      glance recalled to Laura what his mother had once said of him. &ldquo;Richard
      is one of those sweet, helpless men that some women adore and others
      despise. They fall in love with the ones that despise them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An ostentatious cough made her face about, being obviously designed to
      that effect; and she beheld her brother in the act of walking slowly
      across the yard with his back to her. He halted upon the border of her
      small garden of asters, regarded it anxiously, then spread his
      handkerchief upon the ground, knelt upon it, and with thoughtful care
      uprooted a few weeds which were beginning to sprout, and also such vagrant
      blades of grass as encroached upon the floral territory. He had the air of
      a virtuous man performing a good action which would never become known.
      Plainly, he thought himself in solitude and all unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a touching picture, pious and humble. Done into coloured glass, the
      kneeling boy and the asters&mdash;submerged in ardent sunshine&mdash;would
      have appropriately enriched a cathedral: Boyhood of Saint Florus the
      Gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura heartlessly turned her back, and, affecting an interest in her
      sleeve, very soon experienced the sensation of being stared at with some
      poignancy from behind. Unchanged in attitude, she unravelled an imaginary
      thread, whereupon the cough reached her again, shrill and loud, its
      insistence not lacking in pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      She approached him, driftingly. No sign that he was aware came from the
      busied boy, though he coughed again, hollowly now&mdash;a proof that he
      was an artist. &ldquo;All right, Hedrick,&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;I
      heard you the first time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up with utter incomprehension. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve
      caught cold,&rdquo; he said, simply. &ldquo;I got a good many weeds out
      before breakfast, and the ground was damp.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick was of the New School: everything direct, real, no striving for
      effect, no pressure on the stroke. He did his work: you could take it or
      leave it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t strain so, dear,&rdquo; returned his sister,
      shaking her head. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t last if you do. You see this is
      only the first day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck to the heart by so brutal a misconception, he put all his wrongs
      into one look, rose in manly dignity, picked up his handkerchief, and left
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes followed him, not without remorse: it was an exit which would
      have moved the bass-violist of a theatre orchestra. Sighing, she went to
      her own room by way of the kitchen and the back-stairs, and, having locked
      her door, brought the padlocked book from its hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I should not have played as I did, an hour ago,&rdquo; she
      wrote. &ldquo;It stirs me too greatly and I am afraid it makes me inclined
      to self-pity afterward, and I must never let myself feel <i>that</i>! If I
      once begin to feel sorry for myself. . . . But I <i>will</i> not! No. You
      are here in the world. You exist. You <i>are</i>! That is the great thing
      to know and it must be enough for me. It is. I played to You. I played <i>just
      love</i> to you&mdash;all the yearning tenderness&mdash;all the supreme
      kindness I want to give you. Isn&rsquo;t love really just glorified
      kindness? No, there is something more. . . . I feel it, though I do not
      know how to say it. But it was in my playing&mdash;I played it and played
      it. Suddenly I felt that in my playing I had shouted it from the
      housetops, that I had told the secret to all the world and <i>everybody</i>
      knew. I stopped, and for a moment it seemed to me that I was dying of
      shame. But no one understood. No one had even listened. . . . Sometimes it
      seems to me that I am like Cora, that I am very deeply her sister in some
      things. My heart goes all to You&mdash;my revelation of it, my release of
      it, my outlet of it is all here in these pages (except when I play as I
      did to-day and as I shall not play again) and perhaps the writing keeps me
      quiet. Cora scatters her own releasings: she is looking for the You she
      may never find; and perhaps the penalty for scattering is never finding.
      Sometimes I think the seeking has reacted and that now she seeks only what
      will make her feel. I hope she has not found it: I am afraid of this new
      man&mdash;not only for your sake, dear. I felt repelled by his glance at
      me the first time I saw him. I did not like it&mdash;I cannot say just
      why, unless that it seemed too intimate. I am afraid of him for her, which
      is a queer sort of feeling because she has alw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s writing stopped there, for that day, interrupted by a
      hurried rapping upon the door and her mother&rsquo;s voice calling her
      with stress and urgency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening of the door revealed Mrs. Madison in a state of anxious
      perturbation, and admitted the sound of loud weeping and agitated voices
      from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please go down,&rdquo; implored the mother. &ldquo;You can do more
      with her than I can. She and your father have been having a terrible scene
      since Richard went home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura hurried down to the library.

      CHAPTER ELEVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>come</i> in, Laura!&rdquo; cried her sister, as Laura
      appeared in the doorway. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <i>stand</i> there! Come in if
      you want to take part in a grand old family row!&rdquo; With a furious and
      tear-stained face, she was confronting her father who stood before her in
      a resolute attitude and a profuse perspiration. &ldquo;Shut the door!&rdquo;
      shouted Cora violently, adding, as Laura obeyed, &ldquo;Do you want that
      little Pest in here? Probably he&rsquo;s eavesdropping anyway. But what
      difference does it make? I don&rsquo;t care. Let him hear! Let anybody
      hear that wants to! They can hear how I&rsquo;m tortured if they like. I
      didn&rsquo;t close my eyes last night, and now I&rsquo;m being tortured.
      Papa!&rdquo; She stamped her foot. &ldquo;Are you going to take back that
      insult to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`Insult&rsquo;?&rdquo; repeated her father, in angry astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw,&rdquo; said Laura, laughing soothingly and coming to her.
      &ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s nonsense, Cora. Kind old papa couldn&rsquo;t
      do that if he tried. Dear, you know he never insulted anybody in his&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo; screamed Cora, repulsing her. &ldquo;Listen,
      if you&rsquo;ve got to, but let me alone. He did too! He did! He <i>knows</i>
      what he said!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does! He does!&rdquo; cried Cora. &ldquo;He said that I was&mdash;I
      was too much `interested&rsquo; in Mr. Corliss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that an `insult&rsquo;?&rdquo; the father demanded sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the way he said it,&rdquo; Cora protested, sobbing. &ldquo;He
      meant something he didn&rsquo;t <i>say</i>. He did! He did! He <i>meant</i>
      to insult me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did nothing of the kind,&rdquo; shouted the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. I said I couldn&rsquo;t
      understand your getting so excited about the fellow&rsquo;s affairs and
      that you seemed to take a mighty sudden interest in him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what if I <i>do</i>?&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
      I a right to be interested in what I choose? I&rsquo;ve got to be
      interested in <i>something</i>, haven&rsquo;t I? <i>You</i> don&rsquo;t
      make life very interesting, do you? Do you think it&rsquo;s interesting to
      spend the summer in this horrible old house with the paper falling off the
      walls and our rotten old furniture that I work my hands off trying to make
      look decent and can&rsquo;t, and every other girl I know at the seashore
      with motor-cars and motor-boats, or getting a trip abroad and buying her
      clothes in Paris? What do <i>you</i> offer to interest me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate man hung his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what all that
      has to do with it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to leap at him. &ldquo;You <i>don&rsquo;t</i>? You <i>don&rsquo;t</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. And I don&rsquo;t see why you&rsquo;re so crazy
      to please young Corliss about this business unless you&rsquo;re infatuated
      with him. I had an idea&mdash;and I was pleased with it, too, because
      Richard&rsquo;s a steady fellow&mdash;that you were just about engaged to
      Richard Lindley, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Engaged!&rdquo; she cried, repeating the word with bitter contempt.
      &ldquo;Engaged! You don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;ll marry him unless I want
      to, do you? I will if it suits me. I won&rsquo;t if it suits me not to;
      understand that! I don&rsquo;t consider myself engaged to anybody, and you
      needn&rsquo;t either. What on earth has that got to do with your keeping
      Richard Lindley from doing what Mr. Corliss wants him to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not keeping him from anything. He didn&rsquo;t say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did!&rdquo; stormed Cora. &ldquo;He said he would if you went
      into it. He told me this afternoon, an hour ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now wait,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;I talked this over with
      Richard two days ago&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora stamped her foot again in frantic exasperation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      talking about this afternoon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two days ago,&rdquo; he repeated doggedly; &ldquo;and we came to
      the same conclusion: it won&rsquo;t do. He said he couldn&rsquo;t go into
      it unless he went over there to Italy&mdash;and saw for himself just what
      he was putting his money into, and Corliss had told him that it couldn&rsquo;t
      be done; that there wasn&rsquo;t time, and showed him a cablegram from his
      Italian partner saying the secret had leaked out and that they&rsquo;d
      have to form the company in Naples and sell the stock over there if it
      couldn&rsquo;t be done here within the next week. Corliss said he had to
      ask for an immediate answer, and so Richard told him no, yesterday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; groaned Cora. &ldquo;What has that got to do
      with <i>your</i> going into it? You&rsquo;re not going to risk any money!
      I don&rsquo;t ask you to <i>spend</i> anything, do I? You haven&rsquo;t
      got it if I did. All Mr. Corliss wants is your name. Can&rsquo;t you give
      even <i>that</i>? What importance is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it isn&rsquo;t important, what difference does it make
      whether I give it or not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung up her arms as in despairing appeal for patience. &ldquo;It <i>is</i>
      important to him! Richard will do it if you will be secretary of the
      company: he promised me. Mr. Corliss told me your name was worth
      everything here: that men said downtown you could have been rich long ago
      if you hadn&rsquo;t been so square. Richard trusts you; he says you&rsquo;re
      the most trusted man in town&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; he interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Her vehemence increased suddenly to its utmost. &ldquo;No!
      Don&rsquo;t you say that, because it&rsquo;s a lie. That isn&rsquo;t the
      reason you won&rsquo;t do it. You won&rsquo;t do it because you think it
      would please <i>me</i>! You&rsquo;re afraid it might make me <i>happy</i>!
      Happy&mdash;happy&mdash;<i>happy</i>!&rdquo; She beat her breast and cast
      herself headlong upon the sofa, sobbing wildly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come
      near me!&rdquo; she screamed at Laura, and sprang to her feet again,
      dishevelled and frantic. &ldquo;Oh, Christ in heaven! is there such a
      thing as happiness in this beast of a world? I want to leave it. I want to
      go away: I want <i>so</i> to die: Why can&rsquo;t I? Why can&rsquo;t I!
      Why can&rsquo;t I! Oh, God, why <i>can&rsquo;t</i> I die? Why can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her passion culminated in a shriek: she gasped, was convulsed from head to
      foot for a dreadful moment, tore at the bosom of her dress with rigid bent
      fingers, swayed; then collapsed all at once. Laura caught her, and got her
      upon the sofa. In the hall, Mrs. Madison could be heard running and
      screaming to Hedrick to go for the doctor. Next instant, she burst into
      the room with brandy and camphor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could only find these; the ammonia bottle&rsquo;s empty,&rdquo;
      she panted; and the miserable father started hatless, for the drug-store,
      a faint, choked wail from the stricken girl sounding in his ears: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      my heart, mamma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was four blocks to the nearest pharmacy; he made what haste he could in
      the great heat, but to himself he seemed double his usual weight; and the
      more he tried to hurry, the less speed appeared obtainable from his heavy
      legs. When he reached the place at last, he found it crowded with noisy
      customers about the &ldquo;soda-fount&rdquo;; and the clerks were stonily
      slow: they seemed to know that they were &ldquo;already in eternity.&rdquo;
      He got very short of breath on the way home; he ceased to perspire and
      became unnaturally dry; the air was aflame and the sun shot fire upon his
      bare head. His feet inclined to strange disobediences: he walked the last
      block waveringly. A solemn Hedrick met him at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got her to bed,&rdquo; announced the boy. &ldquo;The
      doctor&rsquo;s up there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this ammonia up,&rdquo; said Madison huskily, and sat down
      upon a lower step of the stairway with a jolt, closing his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sick, too?&rdquo; asked Hedrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Run along with that ammonia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Madison a long time that he sat there alone, and he felt very
      dizzy. Once he tried to rise, but had to give it up and remain sitting
      with his eyes shut. At last he heard Cora&rsquo;s door open and close; and
      his wife and the doctor came slowly down the stairs, Mrs. Madison talking
      in the anxious yet relieved voice of one who leaves a sick-room wherein
      the physician pronounces progress encouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re <i>sure</i> her heart trouble isn&rsquo;t organic?&rdquo;
      she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her heart is all right,&rdquo; her companion assured her. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      nothing serious; the trouble is nervous. I think you&rsquo;ll find she&rsquo;ll
      be better after a good sleep. Just keep her quiet. Hadn&rsquo;t she been
      in a state of considerable excitement?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es&mdash;she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! A little upset on account of opposition to a plan she&rsquo;d
      formed, perhaps?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;partly,&rdquo; assented the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he returned, adding with some dryness: &ldquo;I
      thought it just possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madison got to his feet, and stepped down from the stairs for them to pass
      him. He leaned heavily against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think she&rsquo;s going to be all right, Sloane?&rdquo; he
      asked with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No cause to worry,&rdquo; returned the physician. &ldquo;You can
      let her stay in bed to-day if she wants to but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
      broke off, looking keenly at Madison&rsquo;s face, which was the colour of
      poppies. &ldquo;Hello! what&rsquo;s up with <i>you</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all&mdash;right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are?&rdquo; retorted Sloane with sarcasm. &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo;
      he commanded. &ldquo;Sit right where you are&mdash;on the stairs, here,&rdquo;
      and, having enforced the order, took a stethoscope from his pocket.
      &ldquo;Get him a glass of water,&rdquo; he said to Hedrick, who was at his
      elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Madison. &ldquo;<i>He</i> isn&rsquo;t
      going to be sick, is he? You don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s sick <i>now</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t call him very well,&rdquo; answered the physician
      rather grimly, placing his stethoscope upon Madison&rsquo;s breast.
      &ldquo;Get his room ready for him.&rdquo; She gave him a piteous look,
      struck with fear; then obeyed a gesture and ran flutteringly up the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right now,&rdquo; panted Madison, drinking the water
      Hedrick brought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so darned all right,&rdquo; said Sloane coolly, as
      he pocketed his stethoscope. &ldquo;Come, let me help you up. We&rsquo;re
      going to get you to bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an effort at protest, but the physician had his way, and the two
      ascended the stairs slowly, Sloane&rsquo;s arm round his new patient. At
      Cora&rsquo;s door, the latter paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want,&rdquo; said Madison thickly&mdash;&ldquo;I want&mdash;to
      speak to Cora.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pass that up just now,&rdquo; returned the other
      brusquely, and led him on. Madison was almost helpless: he murmured in a
      husky, uncertain voice, and suffered himself to be put to bed. There, the
      doctor &ldquo;worked&rdquo; with him; cold &ldquo;applications&rdquo; were
      ordered; Laura was summoned from the other sick-bed; Hedrick sent flying
      with prescriptions, then to telephone for a nurse. The two women attempted
      questions at intervals, but Sloane replied with orders, and kept them
      busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&mdash;think I&rsquo;m a&mdash;-a pretty sick man, Sloane?&rdquo;
      asked Madison after a long silence, speaking with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re sick, all right,&rdquo; the doctor conceded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I want to speak to Jennie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife rushed to the bed, and knelt beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go to confessing your sins,&rdquo; said Doctor
      Sloane crossly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming out of the woods all right, and
      you&rsquo;ll be sorry if you tell her too, much. I&rsquo;ll begin a little
      flirtation with you, Miss Laura, if you please.&rdquo; And he motioned to
      her to follow him into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father <i>is</i> pretty sick,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;and
      he may be sicker before we get him into shape again. But you needn&rsquo;t
      be worried right now; I think he&rsquo;s not in immediate danger.&rdquo;
      He turned at the sound of Mrs. Madison&rsquo;s step, behind him, and
      repeated to her what he had just said to Laura. &ldquo;I hope your husband
      didn&rsquo;t give himself away enough to be punished when we get him on
      his feet again,&rdquo; he concluded cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, tried to smile through tears, and, crossing the hall,
      entered Cora&rsquo;s room. She came back after a moment, and, rejoining
      the other two at her husband&rsquo;s bedside, found the sick man in a
      stertorous sleep. Presently the nurse arrived, and upon the physician&rsquo;s
      pointed intimation that there were &ldquo;too many people around,&rdquo;
      Laura went to Cora&rsquo;s room. She halted on the threshold in surprise.
      Cora was dressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma says the doctor says he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Cora
      lightly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m feeling so much better myself I thought I&rsquo;d
      put on something loose and go downstairs. I think there&rsquo;s more air
      down there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa isn&rsquo;t all right, dear,&rdquo; said Laura, staring
      perplexedly at Cora&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;something loose,&rdquo; an
      equipment inclusive of something particularly close. &ldquo;The doctor
      says he is very sick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; returned Cora promptly. &ldquo;Old
      Sloane never did know anything. Besides, mamma told me he said papa isn&rsquo;t
      in any danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No `immediate&rsquo; danger,&rdquo; corrected Laura. &ldquo;And
      besides, Doctor Sloane said you were to stay in bed until to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that.&rdquo; Cora went on with her lacing
      impatiently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to lie and stifle in this heat
      when I feel perfectly well again&mdash;not for an old idiot like Sloane!
      He didn&rsquo;t even have sense enough to give me any medicine.&rdquo; She
      laughed. &ldquo;Lucky thing he didn&rsquo;t: I&rsquo;d have thrown it out
      of the window. Kick that slipper to me, will you, dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura knelt and put the slipper on her sister&rsquo;s foot. &ldquo;Cora,
      dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just going to put on a negligee
      and go down and sit in the library, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura!&rdquo; The tone was more than impatient. &ldquo;I wish I
      could be let alone for five whole minutes some time in my life! Don&rsquo;t
      you think I&rsquo;ve stood enough for one day? I can&rsquo;t bear to be
      questioned, questioned, questioned! What do you do it for? Don&rsquo;t you
      see I can&rsquo;t stand anything more? If you can&rsquo;t let me alone I
      do wish you&rsquo;d keep out of my room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura rose and went out; but as she left the door, Cora called after her
      with a rueful laugh: &ldquo;Laura, I know I&rsquo;m a little devil!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, Laura, suffering because she had made no reply to this
      peace-offering, and wishing to atone, sought Cora downstairs and found no
      one. She decided that Cora must still be in her own room; she would go to
      her there. But as she passed the open front door, she saw Cora upon the
      sidewalk in front of the house. She wore a new and elaborate motoring
      costume, charmingly becoming, and was in the act of mounting to a seat
      beside Valentine Corliss in a long, powerful-looking, white &ldquo;roadster&rdquo;
      automobile. The engine burst into staccato thunder, sobered down; the
      wheels began to move both Cora and Corliss were laughing and there was an
      air of triumph about them&mdash;Cora&rsquo;s veil streamed and fluttered:
      and in a flash they were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura stared at the suddenly vacated space where they had been. At a
      thought she started. Then she rushed upstairs to her mother, who was
      sitting in the hall near her husband&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; whispered Laura, flinging herself upon her knees
      beside her, &ldquo;when papa wanted to speak to you, was it a message to
      Cora?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear. He told me to tell her he was sorry he&rsquo;d made her
      sick, and that if he got well he&rsquo;d try to do what she asked him to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura nodded cheerfully. &ldquo;And he <i>will</i> get well, darling
      mother,&rdquo; she said, as she rose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back in a
      minute and sit with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her return was not so quick as she promised, for she lay a long time
      weeping upon her pillow, whispering over and over:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, poor, poor papa! Oh, poor, poor Richard!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWELVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Within a week Mr. Madison&rsquo;s illness was a settled institution in the
      household; the presence of the nurse lost novelty, even to Hedrick, and
      became a part of life; the day was measured by the three regular visits of
      the doctor. To the younger members of the family it seemed already that
      their father had always been sick, and that he always would be; indeed, to
      Cora and Hedrick he had become only a weak and querulous voice beyond a
      closed door. Doctor Sloane was serious but reassuring, his daily
      announcement being that his patient was in &ldquo;no immediate danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Madison did not share her children&rsquo;s sanguine adaptability;
      and, of the three, Cora was the greatest solace to the mother&rsquo;s
      troubled heart, though Mrs. Madison never recognized this without a sense
      of injustice to Laura, for Laura now was housewife and housekeeper&mdash;that
      is, she did all the work except the cooking, and on &ldquo;wash-day&rdquo;
      she did that. But Cora&rsquo;s help was to the very spirit itself, for she
      was sprightly in these hours of trial: with indomitable gayety she cheered
      her mother, inspiring in her a firmer confidence, and, most stimulating of
      all, Cora steadfastly refused to consider her father&rsquo;s condition as
      serious, or its outcome as doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sloane exaggerated, she said; and she made fun of his gravity, his
      clothes and his walk, which she mimicked till she drew a reluctant and
      protesting laugh from even her mother. Mrs. Madison was sure she &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t
      get through&rdquo; this experience save for Cora, who was indeed the light
      of the threatened house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange perversities of this world: Cora&rsquo;s gayety was almost
      unbearable to her brother. Not because he thought it either unfeeling or
      out of place under the circumstances (an aspect he failed to consider),
      but because years of warfare had so frequently made him connect
      cheerfulness on her part with some unworthily won triumph over himself
      that habit prevailed, and he could not be a witness of her high spirits
      without a strong sense of injury. Additionally, he was subject to a deeply
      implanted suspicion of any appearance of unusual happiness in her as
      having source, if not in his own defeat, then in something vaguely &ldquo;soft&rdquo;
      and wholly distasteful. She grated upon him; he chafed, and his sufferings
      reached the surface. Finally, in a reckless moment, one evening at dinner,
      he broke out with a shout and hurled a newly devised couplet concerning
      luv-a-ly slush at his, sister&rsquo;s head. The nurse was present: Cora
      left the table; and Hedrick later received a serious warning from Laura.
      She suggested that it might become expedient to place him in Cora&rsquo;s
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora knows perfectly well that something peculiar happened to you,&rdquo;
      she advised him. &ldquo;And she knows that I know what it was; and she
      says it isn&rsquo;t very sisterly of me not to tell her. Now, Hedrick,
      there was no secret about it; you didn&rsquo;t <i>confide</i> your&mdash;your
      trouble to me, and it would be perfectly honourable of me to tell it. I
      wont{sic} unless you make me, but if you can&rsquo;t be polite and keep
      peace with Cora&mdash;at least while papa is sick I think it may be
      necessary. I believe,&rdquo; she finished with imperfect gravity, &ldquo;that
      it&mdash;it would keep things quieter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The thoughts of a boy may be long, long thoughts, but he cannot
      persistently remember to fear a threatened catastrophe. Youth is too
      quickly intimate with peril. Hedrick had become familiar with his own, had
      grown so accustomed to it he was in danger of forgetting it altogether;
      therefore it was out of perspective. The episode of Lolita had begun to
      appear as a thing of the distant and clouded past: time is so long at
      thirteen. Added to this, his late immaculate deportment had been, as Laura
      suggested, a severe strain; the machinery of his nature was out of
      adjustment and demanded a violent reaction before it could get to running
      again at average speed. Also, it is evident that his destruction had been
      planned on high, for he was mad enough to answer flippantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her! Go on and tell her&mdash;<i>I</i> give you leaf! <i>that</i>
      wasn&rsquo;t anything anyway&mdash;just helped you get a little idiot girl
      home. What is there to that? I never saw her before; never saw her again;
      didn&rsquo;t have half as much to do with her as you did yourself. She was
      a lot more <i>your</i> friend than mine; I didn&rsquo;t even know her. I
      guess you&rsquo;ll have to get something better on me than that, before
      you try to boss <i>this</i> ranch, Laura Madison!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, in bed, he wondered if he had not been perhaps a trifle rash;
      but the day was bright when he awoke, and no apprehension shadowed his
      morning face as he appeared at the breakfast table. On the contrary, a
      great weight had lifted from him; clearly his defiance had been the proper
      thing; he had shown Laura that her power over him was but imaginary.
      Hypnotized by his own words to her, he believed them; and his previous
      terrors became gossamer; nay, they were now merely laughable. His own
      remorse and shame were wholly blotted from memory, and he could not
      understand why in the world he had been so afraid, nor why he had felt it
      so necessary to placate Laura. She looked very meek this morning. <i>That</i>
      showed! The strong hand was the right policy in dealing with women. He was
      tempted to insane daring: the rash, unfortunate child waltzed on the lip
      of the crater.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told Cora yet?&rdquo; he asked, with scornful laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told me what?&rdquo; Cora looked quickly up from her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing about this Corliss,&rdquo; he returned scathingly.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hedrick!&rdquo; remonstrated his mother, out of habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never thinks of anything else these days,&rdquo; he retorted.
      &ldquo;Rides with him every evening in his pe-rin-sley hired machine,
      doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, you should be more careful about the way you handle a
      spoon, Hedrick,&rdquo; said Cora languidly, and with at least a foundation
      of fact. &ldquo;It is not the proper implement for decorating the cheeks.
      We all need nourishment, but it is <i>so</i> difficult when one sees a
      deposit of breakfast-food in the ear of one&rsquo;s vis-a-vis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick too impulsively felt of his ears and was but the worse stung to
      find them immaculate and the latter half of the indictment unjustified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoon!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t talk about spoons
      if I were you, Cora-lee! After what I saw in the library the other night,
      believe <i>me</i>, you&rsquo;re the one of this family that better be
      careful how you `handle a spoon&rsquo;!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora had a moment of panic. She let the cup she was lifting drop noisily
      upon its saucer, and gazed whitely at the boy, her mouth opening wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; he went on, with a dreadful laugh. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      hear you asking this Corliss to kiss you! Oh, no!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, though her mother and Laura both started, a faint, odd relief
      showed itself in Cora&rsquo;s expression. She recovered herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little liar!&rdquo; she flashed, and, with a single quick look
      at her mother, as of one too proud to appeal, left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hedrick, Hedrick, Hedrick!&rdquo; wailed Mrs. Madison. &ldquo;And
      she told me you drove her from the table last night too, right before Miss
      Peirce!&rdquo; Miss Peirce was the nurse, fortunately at this moment in
      the sick-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>did</i> hear her ask him that,&rdquo; he insisted, sullenly.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burning with outrage, he also left his meal unfinished and departed in
      high dignity. He passed through the kitchen, however, on his way out of
      the house; but, finding an unusual politeness to the cook nothing except
      its own reward, went on his way with a bitter perception of the emptiness
      of the world and other places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father managed to talk more last night,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Madison pathetically to Laura. &ldquo;He made me understand that he was
      fretting about how little we&rsquo;d been able to give our children; so
      few advantages; it&rsquo;s always troubled him terribly. But sometimes I
      wonder if we&rsquo;ve done right: we&rsquo;ve neither of us ever exercised
      any discipline. We just couldn&rsquo;t bear to. You see, not having any
      money, or the things money could buy, to give, I think we&rsquo;ve
      instinctively tried to make up for it by indulgence in other ways, and
      perhaps it&rsquo;s been a bad thing. Not,&rdquo; she added hastily,
      &ldquo;not that you aren&rsquo;t all three the best children any mother
      and father ever had! <i>He</i> said so. He said the only trouble was that
      our children were too good for us.&rdquo; She shook her head remorsefully
      throughout Laura&rsquo;s natural reply to this; was silent a while; then,
      as she rose, she said timidly, not looking at her daughter: &ldquo;Of
      course Hedrick didn&rsquo;t mean to tell an outright lie. They were just
      talking, and perhaps he&mdash;perhaps he heard something that made him
      think what he <i>did</i>. People are so often mistaken in what they hear,
      even when they&rsquo;re talking right to each other, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it more likely,&rdquo; said Laura, gravely, &ldquo;that
      Cora was telling some story or incident, and that Hedrick overheard that
      part of it, and thought she was speaking directly to Mr. Corliss?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; cried the mother with instant and buoyant relief;
      and when the three ladies convened, a little later, Cora (unquestioned)
      not only confirmed this explanation, but repeated in detail the story she
      had related to Mr. Corliss. Laura had been quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick passed a variegated morning among comrades. He obtained prestige
      as having a father like-to-die, but another boy turned up who had learned
      to chew tobacco. Then Hedrick was pronounced inferior to others in turning
      &ldquo;cartwheels,&rdquo; but succeeded in a wrestling match for an apple,
      which he needed. Later, he was chased empty-handed from the rear of an
      ice-wagon, but greatly admired for his retorts to the vociferous chaser:
      the other boys rightly considered that what he said to the ice-man was
      much more horrible than what the ice-man said to him. The ice-man had a
      fair vocabulary, but it lacked pliancy; seemed stiff and fastidious
      compared with the flexible Saxon in which Hedrick sketched a family tree
      lacking, perhaps, some plausibility as having produced even an ice-man,
      but curiously interesting zoologically.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came home at noon with the flush of this victory new upon his brow. He
      felt equal to anything, and upon Cora&rsquo;s appearing at lunch with a
      blithe, bright air and a new arrangement of her hair, he opened a fresh
      campaign with ill-omened bravado.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ear-muffs in style for September, are they?&rdquo; he inquired in
      allusion to a symmetrical and becoming undulation upon each side of her
      head. &ldquo;Too bad Ray Vilas can&rsquo;t come any more; he&rsquo;d like
      those, I know he would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora, who was talking jauntily to her mother, went on without heeding. She
      affected her enunciation at times with a slight lisp; spoke preciously and
      over-exquisitely, purposely mincing the letter R, at the same time
      assuming a manner of artificial distinction and conscious elegance which
      never failed to produce in her brother the last stage of exasperation. She
      did this now. Charming woman, that dear Mrs. Villard, she prattled.
      &ldquo;I met her downtown this morning. Dear mamma, you should but have
      seen her delight when she saw <i>me</i>. She was but just returned from
      Bar Harbor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`Baw-hawbaw&rsquo;!&rdquo; Poor Hedrick was successfully infuriated
      immediately. &ldquo;What in thunder is `Baw-hawbaw&rsquo;? Mrs. Villawd!
      Baw-hawbaw! Oh, maw!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had no idea she should find <i>me</i> in town, she said,&rdquo;
      Cora ran on, happily. &ldquo;She came back early on account of the
      children having to be sent to school. She has such adorable children&mdash;beautiful,
      dimpled babes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;SLUSH! SLUSH! LUV-A-LY SLUSH!&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;And her dear son, Egerton Villard, he&rsquo;s grown to be
      such a comely lad, and he has the most charming courtly manners: he helped
      his mother out of her carriage with all the air of a man of the world, and
      bowed to me as to a duchess. I think he might be a great influence for
      good if the dear Villards would but sometimes let him associate a little
      with our unfortunate Hedrick. Egerton Villard is really <i>distingue</i>;
      he has a beautiful head; and if he could be induced but to let Hedrick
      follow him about but a little&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat his beautiful head off for him if he but butts in
      on me but a little!&rdquo; Hedrick promised earnestly. &ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora turned toward him innocently. &ldquo;What did you say, Hedrick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said `Idiot&rsquo;!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Egerton Villard?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m an idiot, Hedrick?&rdquo; Her tone was calm,
      merely inquisitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said pleasantly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think if
      I were <i>really</i> an idiot I&rsquo;d be even fonder of you than I am?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It took his breath. In a panic he sat waiting he knew not what; but Cora
      blandly resumed her interrupted remarks to her mother, beginning a
      description of Mrs. Villard&rsquo;s dress; Laura was talking unconcernedly
      to Miss Peirce; no one appeared to be aware that anything unusual had been
      said. His breath came back, and, summoning his presence of mind, he found
      himself able to consider his position with some degree of assurance.
      Perhaps, after all, Cora&rsquo;s retort had been merely a coincidence. He
      went over and over it in his mind, making a pretence, meanwhile, to be
      busy with his plate. &ldquo;If I were <i>really</i> an idiot.&rdquo; . . .
      It was the &ldquo;<i>really</i>&rdquo; that troubled him. But for that one
      word, he could have decided that her remark was a coincidence; but &ldquo;<i>really</i>&rdquo;
      was ominous; had a sinister ring. &ldquo;If I were <i>really</i> an idiot!&rdquo;
      Suddenly the pleasant clouds that had obscured his memory of the fatal
      evening were swept away as by a monstrous Hand: it all came back to him
      with sickening clearness. So is it always with the sinner with his sin and
      its threatened discovery. Again, in his miserable mind, he sat beside
      Lolita on the fence, with the moon shining through her hair; and he knew&mdash;for
      he had often read it&mdash;that a man could be punished his whole life
      through for a single moment&rsquo;s weakness. A man might become rich,
      great, honoured, and have a large family, but his one soft sin would
      follow him, hunt him out and pull him down at last. &ldquo;<i>Really</i>
      an idiot!&rdquo; Did that relentless Comanche, Cora, know this Thing? He
      shuddered. Then he fell back upon his faith in Providence. It <i>could</i>
      not be that she knew! Ah, no! Heaven would not let the world be so bad as
      that! And yet it did sometimes become negligent&mdash;he remembered the
      case of a baby-girl cousin who fell into the bath-tub and was drowned.
      Providence had allowed that: What assurance had he that it would not go a
      step farther?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Hedrick,&rdquo; said Cora, turning toward him cheerfully,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not really eating anything; you&rsquo;re only
      pretending to.&rdquo; His heart sank with apprehension. Was it coming?
      &ldquo;You really must eat,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;School begins so
      soon, you must be strong, you know. How we shall miss you here at home
      during your hours of work!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, the burden fell from his shoulders, his increasing terrors took
      wing. If Laura had told his ghastly secret to Cora, the latter would not
      have had recourse to such weak satire as this. Cora was not the kind of
      person to try a popgun on an enemy when she had a thirteen-inch gun at her
      disposal; so he reasoned; and in the gush of his relief and happiness,
      responded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little too cocky lately, Cora-lee: I wish you were
      <i>my</i> daughter&mdash;just about five minutes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora looked upon him fondly. &ldquo;What would you do to me,&rdquo; she
      inquired with a terrible sweetness&mdash;&ldquo;darling little boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick&rsquo;s head swam. The blow was square in the face; it jarred
      every bone; the world seemed to topple. His mother, rising from her chair,
      choked slightly, and hurried to join the nurse, who was already on her way
      upstairs. Cora sent an affectionate laugh across the table to her stunned
      antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t beat me, would you, dear?&rdquo; she murmured.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost sure you wouldn&rsquo;t; not if I asked you to
      kiss me some <i>more</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All doubt was gone, the last hope fled! The worst had arrived. A vision of
      the awful future flamed across his staggered mind. The doors to the arena
      were flung open: the wild beasts howled for hunger of him; the spectators
      waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora began lightly to sing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      . . . &ldquo;Dear,
    Would thou wert near
    To hear me tell how fair thou art!
    Since thou art gone I mourn all alone,
    Oh, my Lolita&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She broke off to explain: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of those passionate little
      Spanish serenades, Hedrick. I&rsquo;ll sing it for your boy-friends next
      time they come to play in the yard. I think they&rsquo;d like it. When
      they know why you like it so much, I&rsquo;m sure they will. Of course you
      <i>do</i> like it&mdash;you roguish little lover!&rdquo; A spasm rewarded
      this demoniacal phrase. &ldquo;Darling little boy, the serenade goes on
      like this:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Oh, my Lolita, come to my heart:
    Oh, come beloved, love let me press thee,
    While I caress thee
    In one long kiss, Lolita!
    Lolita come! Let me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Hedrick sprang to his feet with a yell of agony. &ldquo;Laura Madison, you
      tattle-tale,&rdquo; he bellowed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forgive you as
      long as I live! I&rsquo;ll get even with you if it takes a thousand years!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, and pausing merely to kick a rung out of a chair which happened
      to be in his way, he rushed from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sisters had risen to go, and Cora flung her arms round Laura in
      ecstacy. &ldquo;You mean old viper!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You could
      have told me days ago! It&rsquo;s almost too good to be true: it&rsquo;s
      the first time in my whole life I&rsquo;ve felt safe from the Pest for a
      moment!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura shook her head. &ldquo;My conscience troubles me; it did seem as if
      I ought to tell you&mdash;and mamma thought so, too; and I gave him
      warning, but now that I have done it, it seems rather mean and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora. &ldquo;You just gave me a chance to
      protect myself for once, thank heaven!&rdquo; And she picked up her skirts
      and danced her way into the front hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Laura, following, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
      have done it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Laura,&rdquo; cried the younger girl, &ldquo;I am having the
      best time, these days! This just caps it.&rdquo; She lowered her voice,
      but her eyes grew even brighter. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve shown a certain
      gentleman a few things he didn&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Val,&rdquo; returned Cora lightly; &ldquo;Valentine Corliss. I
      think he knows a little more about women than he did when he first came
      here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a difference with him?&rdquo; asked Laura with
      eager hopefulness. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve broken with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord, no! Nothing like that.&rdquo; Cora leaned to her
      confidentially. &ldquo;He told me, once, he&rsquo;d be at the feet of any
      woman that could help put through an affair like his oil scheme, and I
      decided I&rsquo;d just show him what I could do. He&rsquo;d talk about it
      to me; then he&rsquo;d laugh at me. That very Sunday when I got papa to go
      in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Laura helplessly. &ldquo;He only
      said he&rsquo;d try to&mdash;&mdash;when he gets well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same&mdash;and it&rsquo;ll be a great thing for
      him, too,&rdquo; said Cora, gayly. &ldquo;Well, that very afternoon before
      Val left, he practically told me I was no good. Of course he didn&rsquo;t
      use just those words&mdash;that isn&rsquo;t his way&mdash;but he laughed
      at me. And haven&rsquo;t I shown him! I sent Richard a note that very
      night saying papa had consented to be secretary of the company, and
      Richard had said he&rsquo;d go in if papa did that, and he couldn&rsquo;t
      break his word&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Laura, sighing. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura&rdquo;&mdash;Cora spoke with sudden gravity&mdash;&ldquo;did
      you ever know anybody like me? I&rsquo;m almost getting superstitious
      about it, because it seems to me I <i>always</i> get just what I set out
      to get. I believe I could have anything in the world if I tried for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, if you tried for something good for you,&rdquo; said
      Laura sadly. &ldquo;Cora, dear, you will&mdash;you will be a little easy
      on Hedrick, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora leaned against the newel and laughed till she was exhausted.

      CHAPTER THIRTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Trumble&rsquo;s offices were heralded by a neat blazon upon the
      principal door, &ldquo;Wade J. Trumble, Mortgages and Loans&rdquo;; and
      the gentleman thus comfortably, proclaimed, emerging from that door upon a
      September noontide, burlesqued a start of surprise at sight of a figure
      unlocking an opposite door which exhibited the name, &ldquo;Ray Vilas,&rdquo;
      and below it, the cryptic phrase, &ldquo;Probate Law.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Trumble, affecting to faint. &ldquo;You
      ain&rsquo;t going in <i>there</i>, are you, Ray?&rdquo; He followed the
      other into the office, and stood leaning against a bookcase, with his
      hands in his pockets, while Vilas raised the two windows, which were
      obscured by a film of smoke-deposit: there was a thin coat of fine sifted
      dust over everything. &ldquo;Better not sit down, Ray,&rdquo; continued
      Trumble, warningly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll spoil your clothes and you might
      get a client. That word `Probate&rsquo; on the door ain&rsquo;t going to
      keep &rsquo;em out forever. You recognize the old place, I s&rsquo;pose?
      You must have been here at least twice since you moved in. What&rsquo;s
      the matter? Dick Lindley hasn&rsquo;t missionaried you into any idea of <i>working</i>,
      has he? Oh, no, <i>I</i> see: the Richfield Hotel bar has closed&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      managed to drink it all at last!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard how old man Madison is to-day?&rdquo; asked Ray,
      dusting his fingers with a handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody told me yesterday he was about the same. He&rsquo;s not
      going to get well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Ray spoke quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stroke too severe. People never recover&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, they do, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Trumble began hotly: &ldquo;I beg to dif&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but checked
      himself, manifesting a slight confusion. &ldquo;That is, I know they don&rsquo;t.
      Old Madison may live a while, if you call that getting well; but he&rsquo;ll
      never be the same man he was. Doctor Sloane says it was a bad stroke. Says
      it was `induced by heat prostration and excitement.&rsquo; `Excitement!&rsquo;&rdquo;
      he repeated with a sour laugh. &ldquo;Yep, I expect a man could get all
      the excitement he wanted in <i>that</i> house, especially if he was her
      daddy. Poor old man, I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s got five thousand
      dollars in the world, and look how she dresses!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ray opened a compartment beneath one of the bookcases, and found a bottle
      and some glasses. &ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;our janitor doesn&rsquo;t
      drink, I perceive. Join me?&rdquo; Mr. Trumble accepted, and Ray
      explained, cheerfully: &ldquo;Richard Lindley&rsquo;s got me so cowed I&rsquo;m
      afraid to go near any of my old joints. You see, he trails me; the
      scoundrel has kept me sober for whole days at a time, and I&rsquo;ve been
      mortified, having old friends see me in that condition; so I have to sneak
      up here to my own office to drink to Cora, now and then. You mustn&rsquo;t
      tell him. What&rsquo;s she been doing to <i>you</i>, lately?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man addressed grew red with the sharp, resentful memory.
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing! Just struck me in the face with her parasol on the
      public street, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; He gave an account of his walk to
      church with Cora. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m through with that girl!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed vindictively, in conclusion. &ldquo;It was the damnedest thing
      you ever saw in your life: right in broad daylight, in front of the
      church. And she laughed when she did it; you&rsquo;d have thought she was
      knocking a puppy out of her way. She can&rsquo;t do that to me twice, I
      tell you. What the devil do you see to laugh at?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be around,&rdquo; returned his companion, refilling
      the glasses, &ldquo;asking for more, the first chance she gives you. Here&rsquo;s
      her health!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t drink it!&rdquo; cried Mr. Trumble angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m through with her for good, I tell you! I&rsquo;m not
      your kind: I don&rsquo;t let a girl like that upset me till I can&rsquo;t
      think of anything else, and go making such an ass of myself that the whole
      town gabbles about it. Cora Madison&rsquo;s seen the last of me, I&rsquo;ll
      thank you to notice. She&rsquo;s never been half-decent to me; cut dances
      with me all last winter; kept me hanging round the outskirts of every
      crowd she was in; stuck me with Laura and her mother every time she had a
      chance; then has the nerve to try to use me, so&rsquo;s she can make a
      bigger hit with a new man! You can bet your head I&rsquo;m through! She&rsquo;ll
      get paid though! Oh, she&rsquo;ll get paid for it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; laughed Ray.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a difficult question. &ldquo;You wait and see,&rdquo; responded the
      threatener, feebly. &ldquo;Just wait and see. She&rsquo;s wild about this
      Corliss, I tell you,&rdquo; he continued, with renewed vehemence. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      crazy about him; she&rsquo;s lost her head at last&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean he&rsquo;s going to avenge you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, though he might, if she decided to marry him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Ray slowly, glancing over his glass at his
      nervous companion, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t strike me that Mr. Valentine
      Corliss has much the air of a marrying man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has the air to <i>me</i>,&rdquo; observed Mr. Trumble, &ldquo;of
      a darned bad lot! But I have to hand it to him: he&rsquo;s a wizard. He&rsquo;s
      got something besides his good looks&mdash;a man that could get Cora
      Madison interested in `business&rsquo;! In <i>oil</i>! Cora Madison! How
      do you suppose&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion began to laugh again. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really suppose
      he talked his oil business to her, do you, Trumble?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have. Else how could she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Cora herself never talks upon any subject but one; she
      never listens to any other either.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how in thunder did he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Cora asks you if you think it will rain,&rdquo; interrupted
      Vilas, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t she really seem to be asking: `Do you love me?
      How much?&rsquo; Suppose Mr. Corliss is an expert in the same line. Of
      course he can talk about oil!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He strikes me,&rdquo; said Trumble, &ldquo;as just about the
      slickest customer that ever hit this town. I like Richard Lindley, and I
      hope he&rsquo;ll see his fifty thousand dollars again. <i>I</i> wouldn&rsquo;t
      have given Corliss thirty cents.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think he&rsquo;s a crook?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; returned Trumble. &ldquo;All <i>I</i>
      know about him is that he&rsquo;s done some of the finest work to get
      fifty thousand dollars put in his hands that I ever heard of. And all
      anybody knows about him is that he lived here seventeen years ago, and
      comes back claiming to know where there&rsquo;s oil in Italy. He shows
      some maps and papers and gets cablegrams signed `Moliterno.&rsquo; Then he
      talks about selling the old Corliss house here, where the Madisons live,
      and putting the money into his oil company: he does that to sound
      plausible, but I have good reason to know that house was mortgaged to its
      full value within a month after his aunt left it to him. He&rsquo;ll not
      get a cent if it&rsquo;s sold. That&rsquo;s all. And he&rsquo;s got Cora
      Madison so crazy over him that she makes life a hell for poor old Lindley
      until he puts all he&rsquo;s saved into the bubble. The scheme may be all
      right. How do <i>I</i> know? There&rsquo;s no way to tell, without going
      over there, and Corliss won&rsquo;t let anybody do that&mdash;oh, he&rsquo;s
      got a plausible excuse for it! But I&rsquo;m sorry for Lindley: he&rsquo;s
      so crazy about Cora, he&rsquo;s soft. And she&rsquo;s so crazy about
      Corliss <i>she&rsquo;s</i> soft! Well, I used to be crazy about her
      myself, but I&rsquo;m not soft&mdash;I&rsquo;m not the Lindley kind of
      loon, thank heaven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind are you, Trumble?&rdquo; asked Ray, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not your kind either,&rdquo; retorted the other going to the door.
      &ldquo;She cut me on the street the other day; she&rsquo;s quit speaking
      to me. If you&rsquo;ve got any money, why don&rsquo;t you take it over to
      the hotel and give it to Corliss? She might start speaking to <i>you</i>
      again. I&rsquo;m going to lunch!&rdquo; He slammed the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ray Vilas, left alone, elevated his heels to the sill, and stared out of
      the window a long time at a gravelled roof which presented little of
      interest. He replenished his glass and his imagination frequently, the
      latter being so stirred that when, about three o&rsquo;clock, he noticed
      the inroads he had made upon the bottle, tears of self-pity came to his
      eyes. &ldquo;Poor little drunkard!&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;Go ahead
      and do it. Isn&rsquo;t anything <i>you</i> won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo; And,
      having washed his face at a basin in a corner, he set his hat slightly
      upon one side, picked up a walking stick and departed jauntily, and, to
      the outward eye, presentably sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Valentine Corliss would be glad to see him, the clerk at the Richfield
      Hotel reported, after sending up a card, and upon Ray&rsquo;s following
      the card, Mr. Valentine Corliss in person confirmed the message with
      considerable amusement and a cordiality in which there was some mixture of
      the quizzical. He was the taller; and the robust manliness of his
      appearance, his splendid health and boxer&rsquo;s figure offered a sharp
      contrast to the superlatively lean tippler. Corliss was humorously aware
      of his advantage: his greeting seemed really to say, &ldquo;Hello, my
      funny bug, here you are again!&rdquo; though the words of his salutation
      were entirely courteous; and he followed it with a hospitable offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Vilas; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t drink with you.&rdquo;
      He spoke so gently that the form of his refusal, usually interpreted as
      truculent, escaped the other&rsquo;s notice. He also declined a cigar,
      apologetically asking permission to light one of his own cigarettes; then,
      as he sank into a velour-covered chair, apologized again for the
      particular attention he was bestowing upon the apartment, which he
      recognized as one of the suites de luxe of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`Parlour, bedroom, and bath,&rsquo;&rdquo; he continued, with a
      melancholy smile; &ldquo;and `Lachrymae,&rsquo; and `A Reading from Homer.&rsquo;
      Sometimes they have `The Music Lesson,&rsquo; or `Winter Scene&rsquo; or
      `A Neapolitan Fisher Lad&rsquo; instead of `Lachrymae,&rsquo; but they
      always have `A Reading from Homer.&rsquo; When you opened the door, a
      moment ago, I had a very strong impression that something extraordinary
      would some time happen to me in this room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; suggested Corliss, &ldquo;you refused a drink in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even more wonderful than that,&rdquo; said Ray, glancing about the
      place curiously. &ldquo;It may be a sense of something painful that
      already has happened here&mdash;perhaps long ago, before your occupancy.
      It has a pathos.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most hotel rooms have had something happen in them,&rdquo; said
      Corliss lightly. &ldquo;I believe the managers usually change the door
      numbers if what happens is especially unpleasant. Probably they change
      some of the rugs, also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Ray paused, frowning. &ldquo;I feel as
      if some one had killed himself here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then no doubt some of the rugs <i>have</i> been changed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt.&rdquo; The caller laughed and waved his hand in dismissal
      of the topic. &ldquo;Well, Mr. Corliss,&rdquo; he went on, shifting to a
      brisker tone, &ldquo;I have come to make my fortune, too. You are Midas.
      Am I of sufficient importance to be touched?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine Corliss gave him sidelong an almost imperceptibly brief glance
      of sharpest scrutiny&mdash;it was like the wink of a camera shutter&mdash;but
      laughed in the same instant. &ldquo;Which way do you mean that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been quick,&rdquo; returned the visitor, repaying that
      glance with equal swiftness, &ldquo;to seize upon the American idiom. I
      mean: How small a contribution would you be willing to receive toward your
      support!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Corliss did not glance again at Ray; instead, he looked interested in the
      smoke of his cigar. &ldquo;`Contribution,&rsquo;&rdquo; he repeated, with
      no inflection whatever. &ldquo;`Toward my support.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, of course, how small an investment in your oil company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, anything, anything,&rdquo; returned the promoter, with quick
      amiability. &ldquo;We need to sell all the stock we can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the money you can get?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. It&rsquo;s really a colossal proposition, Mr. Vilas.&rdquo;
      Corliss spoke with brisk enthusiasm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a perfectly certain
      enormous profit upon everything that goes in. Prince Moliterno cables me
      later investigations show that the oil-field is more than twice as large
      as we thought when I left Naples. He&rsquo;s on the ground now, buying up
      what he can, secretly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had an impression from Richard Lindley that the secret had been
      discovered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; but only by a few, and those are trying to keep it quiet
      from the others, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Does your partner know of your success in raising a large
      investment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Lindley&rsquo;s? Certainly.&rdquo; Corliss waved his hand
      in light deprecation. &ldquo;Of course that&rsquo;s something, but
      Moliterno would hardly be apt to think of it as very large! You see he&rsquo;s
      putting in about five times that much, himself, and I&rsquo;ve already
      turned over to him double it for myself. Still, it counts&mdash;certainly;
      and of course it will be a great thing for Lindley.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; Ray said hesitatingly, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t be
      much interested in my drop for your bucket. I have twelve hundred dollars
      in the world; and it is in the bank&mdash;I stopped there on my way here.
      To be exact, I have twelve hundred and forty-seven dollars and fifty-one
      cents. My dear sir, will you allow me to purchase one thousand dollars&rsquo;
      worth of stock? I will keep the two hundred and forty-seven dollars and
      fifty-one cents to live on&mdash;I may need an egg while waiting for you
      to make me rich. Will you accept so small an investment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Corliss, laughing. &ldquo;Why not? You may
      as well profit by the chance as any one. I&rsquo;ll send you the stock
      certificates&mdash;we put them at par. I&rsquo;m attending to that myself,
      as our secretary, Mr. Madison, is unable to take up his duties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Vilas took a cheque-book and a fountain-pen from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, any time, any time,&rdquo; said Corliss cheerfully, observing
      the new investor&rsquo;s movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I think,&rdquo; returned Vilas quietly. &ldquo;How shall I
      make it out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to me, I suppose,&rdquo; answered Corliss indifferently.
      &ldquo;That will save a little trouble, and I can turn it over to
      Moliterno, by cable, as I did Lindley&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ll give you a
      receipt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not mind that,&rdquo; said Ray. &ldquo;Really it is of no
      importance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course the cheque itself is a receipt,&rdquo; remarked Corliss,
      tossing it carelessly upon a desk. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have some handsome
      returns for that slip of paper, Mr. Vilas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that blithe hope I came,&rdquo; said Ray airily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am confident of it. I have my own ways of divination, Mr.
      Corliss. I have gleams.&rdquo; He rose as if to go, but stood looking
      thoughtfully about the apartment again. &ldquo;Singular impression,&rdquo;
      he murmured. &ldquo;Not exactly as if I&rsquo;d seen it in a dream; and
      yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have symptoms of clairvoyance at times, I take it.&rdquo; The
      conscious, smooth superiority of the dexterous man playing with an
      inconsequent opponent resounded in this speech, clear as the humming of a
      struck bell; and Vilas shot him a single open glance of fire from hectic
      eyes. For that instant, the frailer buck trumpeted challenge. Corliss&mdash;broad-shouldered,
      supple of waist, graceful and strong&mdash;smiled down negligently; yet
      the very air between the two men seemed charged with an invisible
      explosive. Ray laughed quickly, as in undisturbed good nature; then,
      flourishing his stick, turned toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, it isn&rsquo;t clairvoyance&mdash;no more than when I told
      you that your only real interest is women.&rdquo; He paused, his hand upon
      the door-knob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a quaint mixture, however: perhaps I
      should be handled with care.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good of you,&rdquo; laughed Corliss&mdash;&ldquo;this warning.
      The afternoon I had the pleasure of meeting you I think I remember your
      implying that you were a mere marionette.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A haggard harlequin!&rdquo; snapped Vilas, waving his hand to a
      mirror across the room. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I look it?&rdquo; And the
      phrase fitted him with tragic accuracy. &ldquo;You see? What a merry
      wedding-guest I&rsquo;ll be! I invite you to join me on the nuptial eve.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Who&rsquo;s getting married: when the nuptial eve?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ray opened the door, and, turning, rolled his eyes fantastically. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
      you heard?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;When Hecate marries John Barleycorn!&rdquo;
      He bowed low. &ldquo;Mr. Midas, adieu.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Corliss stood in the doorway and watched him walk down the long hall to
      the elevator. There, Ray turned and waved his hand, the other responding
      with gayety which was not assumed: Vilas might be insane, or drunk, or
      both, but the signature upon his cheque was unassailable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corliss closed the door and began to pace his apartment thoughtfully. His
      expression manifested a peculiar phenomenon. In company, or upon the
      street, or when he talked with men, the open look and frank eyes of this
      stalwart young man were disarming and his most winning assets. But now, as
      he paced alone in his apartment, now that he was not upon exhibition, now
      when there was no eye to behold him, and there was no reason to
      dissimulate or veil a single thought or feeling, his look was anything but
      open; the last trace of frankness disappeared; the muscles at mouth and
      eyes shifted; lines and planes intermingled and altered subtly; there was
      a moment of misty transformation&mdash;and the face of another man
      emerged. It was the face of a man uninstructed in mercy; it was a shrewd
      and planning face: alert, resourceful, elaborately perceptive, and
      flawlessly hard. But, beyond all, it was the face of a man perpetually on
      guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the air of debating a question, his hands in his pockets, his
      handsome forehead lined with a temporary indecision. His sentry-go
      extended the length of his two rooms, and each time he came back into his
      bedroom his glance fell consideringly upon a steamer-trunk of the largest
      size, at the foot of his bed. The trunk was partially packed as if for
      departure. And, indeed, it was the question of departure which he was
      debating.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of varied dexterities, and he had one faculty of high value,
      which had often saved him, had never betrayed him; it was intuitive and
      equal to a sixth sense: he always knew when it was time to go. An inner
      voice warned him; he trusted to it and obeyed it. And it had spoken now,
      and there was his trunk half-packed in answer. But he had stopped midway
      in his packing, because he had never yet failed to make a clean sweep
      where there was the slightest chance for one; he hated to leave a big job
      before it was completely finished&mdash;and Mr. Wade Trumble had refused
      to invest in the oil-fields of Basilicata.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corliss paused beside the trunk, stood a moment immersed in thought; then
      nodded once, decisively, and, turning to a dressing-table, began to place
      some silver-mounted brushes and bottles in a leather travelling-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the outer door. He frowned, set down what he had in
      his hands, went to the door and opened it to find Mr. Pryor, that plain
      citizen, awaiting entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corliss remained motionless in an arrested attitude, his hand upon the
      knob of the opened door. His position did not alter; he became almost
      unnaturally still, a rigidity which seemed to increase. Then he looked
      quickly behind him, over his shoulder, and back again, with a swift
      movement of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pryor, at that. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you. I
      just thought I&rsquo;d have two minutes&rsquo; talk with you. All right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Corliss quietly. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; He
      turned carelessly, and walked away from the door keeping between his guest
      and the desk. When he reached the desk, he turned again and leaned against
      it, his back to it, but in the action of turning his hand had swept a
      sheet of note-paper over Ray Vilas&rsquo;s cheque&mdash;a too conspicuous
      oblong of pale blue. Pryor had come in and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he began, regarding the other through
      his glasses, with steady eyes, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m going to interfere
      with you at all, Corliss. I just happened to strike you&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t
      looking for you. I&rsquo;m on vacation, visiting my married daughter that
      lives here, and I don&rsquo;t want to mix in if I can help it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Corliss laughed, easily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing for you to mix in.
      You couldn&rsquo;t if you wanted to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Pryor, with an air of
      indulgence, curiously like that of a teacher for a pupil who promises
      improvement. &ldquo;I do indeed. There isn&rsquo;t anybody I&rsquo;d like
      to see turn straight more than you. You&rsquo;re educated and cultured,
      and refined, and smarter than all hell. It would be a big thing. That&rsquo;s
      one reason I&rsquo;m taking the trouble to talk to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I wasn&rsquo;t doing anything,&rdquo; said Corliss with
      a petulance as oddly like that of a pupil as the other&rsquo;s indulgence
      was like that of a tutor. &ldquo;This is my own town; I own property here,
      and I came here to sell it. I can prove it in half-a-minute&rsquo;s
      telephoning. Where do you come in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy, easy,&rdquo; said Pryor, soothingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just
      told you I don&rsquo;t want to come in at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what do you want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to tell you just one thing: to go easy up there at Mr.
      Madison&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Corliss laughed contemptuously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>my</i> house. I own
      it. That&rsquo;s the property I came here to sell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; responded Pryor. &ldquo;That part of it&rsquo;s
      all right. But I&rsquo;ve seen you several times with that young lady, and
      you looked pretty thick, to me. You know you haven&rsquo;t got any
      business doing such things, Corliss. I know your record from Buda Pesth to
      Copenhagen and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, my friend,&rdquo; said the younger man, angrily, &ldquo;you
      may be a tiptop spotter for the government when it comes to running down
      some poor old lady that&rsquo;s bought a string of pearls in the Rue de la
      Paix&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in the service twenty-eight years,&rdquo; remarked
      Pryor, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the other with a gesture of impatience;
      &ldquo;and you got me once, all right. Well, that&rsquo;s over, isn&rsquo;t
      it? Have I tried anything since?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in that line,&rdquo; said Pryor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what business have you with any other line?&rdquo; demanded
      Corliss angrily. &ldquo;Who made you general supervisor of public morals?
      I want to know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what&rsquo;s the use your getting excited? I&rsquo;m just here
      to tell you that I&rsquo;m going to keep an eye on you. I don&rsquo;t know
      many people here, and I haven&rsquo;t taken any particular pains to look
      you up. For all I know, you&rsquo;re only here to sell your house, as you
      say. But I know old man Madison a little, and I kind of took a fancy to
      him; he&rsquo;s a mighty nice old man, and he&rsquo;s got a nice family.
      He&rsquo;s sick and it won&rsquo;t do to trouble him; but&mdash;honest,
      Corliss&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t slack off in that neighbourhood a little,
      I&rsquo;ll have to have a talk with the young lady herself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A derisory light showed faintly in the younger man&rsquo;s eyes as he
      inquired, softly: &ldquo;That all, Mr. Pryor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Don&rsquo;t try anything on out here. Not in <i>any</i> of your
      lines.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Sell your house and clear out. You&rsquo;ll
      find it healthy.&rdquo; He went to the door. &ldquo;So far as I can see,&rdquo;
      he observed, ruminatively, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t brought any of that
      Moliterno crowd you used to work with over to this side with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Moliterno for two years,&rdquo; said Corliss,
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve said my say.&rdquo; Pryor gave him a last word as
      he went out. &ldquo;You keep away from that little girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ass!&rdquo; exclaimed Corliss, as the door closed. He exhaled a
      deep breath sharply, and broke into a laugh. Then he went quickly into his
      bedroom and began to throw the things out of his trunk.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FOURTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hedrick Madison&rsquo;s eyes were not of marble; his heart was not flint
      nor his skin steel plate: he was flesh and tender; he was a vulnerable,
      breathing boy, with highly developed capacities for pain which were now
      being taxed to their utmost. Once he had loved to run, to leap, to disport
      himself in the sun, to drink deep of the free air; he had loved life and
      one or two of his fellowmen. He had borne himself buoyantly, with jaunty
      self-confidence, even with some intolerance toward the weaknesses of
      others, not infrequently displaying merriment over their mischances; but
      his time had found him at last; the evil day had come. Indian Summer was
      Indian for him, indeed: sweet death were welcome; no charity was left in
      him. He leaped no more, but walked broodingly and sought the dark places.
      And yet it could not be said that times were dull for him: the luckless
      picket who finds himself in an open eighty-acre field, under the eye of a
      sharpshooter up a tree, would not be apt to describe the experience as
      dull. And Cora never missed a shot; she loved the work; her pleasure in it
      was almost as agonizing for the target as was the accuracy of her fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was ingenious: the horrible facts at her disposal were damaging enough
      in all conscience: but they did not content her. She invented a
      love-story, assuming that Hedrick was living it: he was supposed to be
      pining for Lolita, to be fading, day-by-day, because of enforced
      separation; and she contrived this to such an effect of reality, and with
      such a diabolical affectation of delicacy in referring to it, that the
      mere remark, with gentle sympathy, &ldquo;I think poor Hedrick is looking
      a little better to-day,&rdquo; infallibly produced something closely
      resembling a spasm. She formed the habit of never mentioning her brother
      in his presence except as &ldquo;poor Hedrick,&rdquo; a too obvious
      commiseration of his pretended attachment&mdash;which met with like
      success. Most dreadful of all, she invented romantic phrases and
      expressions assumed to have been spoken or written by Hedrick in reference
      to his unhappiness; and she repeated them so persistently, yet always with
      such apparent sincerity of belief that they were quotations from him, and
      not her inventions, that the driven youth knew a fear, sometimes, that the
      horrid things were actually of his own perpetration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most withering of these was, &ldquo;Torn from her I love by the
      ruthless hand of a parent. . . .&rdquo; It was not completed; Cora never
      got any further with it, nor was there need: a howl of fury invariably
      assured her of an effect as satisfactory as could possibly have been
      obtained by an effort less impressionistic. Life became a series of easy
      victories for Cora, and she made them somehow the more deadly for Hedrick
      by not seeming to look at him in his affliction, nor even to be aiming his
      way: he never could tell when the next shot was coming. At the table, the
      ladies of his family might be deep in dress, or discussing Mr. Madison&rsquo;s
      slowly improving condition, when Cora, with utter irrelevance, would sigh,
      and, looking sadly into her coffee, murmur, &ldquo;Ah, <i>fond</i> mem&rsquo;ries!&rdquo;
      or, &ldquo;<i>Why</i> am I haunted by the dead past?&rdquo; or, the
      dreadful, &ldquo;Torn from her I love by the ruthless hand of a parent. .
      . .&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was compassion in Laura&rsquo;s eyes and in his mother&rsquo;s, but
      Cora was irresistible, and they always ended by laughing in spite of
      themselves; and though they pleaded for Hedrick in private, their
      remonstrances proved strikingly ineffective. Hedrick was the only person
      who had ever used the high hand with Cora: she found repayment too
      congenial. In the daytime he could not go in the front yard, but Cora&rsquo;s
      window would open and a tenderly smiling Cora lean out to call
      affectionately, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t walk on the grass&mdash;darling little
      boy!&rdquo; Or, she would nod happily to him and begin to sing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Oh come beloved, love let me press thee,
    While I caress thee
    In one long kiss, Lolita. . . . &rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      One terror still hung over him. If it fell&mdash;as it might at any fatal
      moment&mdash;then the utmost were indeed done upon him; and this
      apprehension bathed his soul in night. In his own circle of congenial age
      and sex he was, by virtue of superior bitterness and precocity of speech,
      a chief&mdash;a moral castigator, a satirist of manners, a creator of
      stinging nicknames; and many nourished unhealed grievances which they had
      little hope of satisfying against him; those who attempted it invariably
      departing with more to avenge than they had brought with them. Let these
      once know what Cora knew. . . . The vision was unthinkable!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Cora&rsquo;s patent desire to release the hideous item, to spread
      the scandal broadcast among his fellows&mdash;to ring it from the
      school-bells, to send it winging on the hot winds of Hades! The boys had
      always liked his yard and the empty stable to play in, and the devices he
      now employed to divert their activities elsewhere were worthy of a great
      strategist. His energy and an abnormal ingenuity accomplished incredible
      things: school had been in session several weeks and only one boy had come
      within conversational distance of Cora;&mdash;him Hedrick bore away
      bodily, in simulation of resistless high spirits, a brilliant exhibition
      of stagecraft.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Cora&rsquo;s friend, Mrs. Villard, removed her son Egerton from
      the private school he had hitherto attended, and he made his appearance in
      Hedrick&rsquo;s class, one morning at the public school. Hedrick&rsquo;s
      eye lighted with a savage gleam; timidly the first joy he had known for a
      thousand years crept into his grim heart. After school, Egerton expiated a
      part of Cora&rsquo;s cruelty. It was a very small part, and the exploit no
      more than infinitesimally soothing to the conqueror, but when Egerton
      finally got home he was no sight for a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Hedrick wrought his own doom: Mrs. Villard telephoned to Cora, and
      Cora went immediately to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened to Hedrick that he was late leaving home the next morning. His
      entrance into his classroom was an undeniable sensation, and within ten
      minutes the teacher had lost all control of the school. It became
      necessary to send for the principal. Recess was a frantic nightmare for
      Hedrick, and his homeward progress at noon a procession of such uproarious
      screamers as were his equals in speed. The nethermost depths were reached
      when an ignoble pigtailed person he had always trodden upon flat-footed
      screamed across the fence from next door, as he reached fancied sanctuary
      in his own backyard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me some <i>more</i>, darling little boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This worm, established upon the fence opposite the conservatory windows,
      and in direct view from the table in the dining-room, shrieked the
      accursed request at short intervals throughout the luncheon hour. The
      humour of childhood is sometimes almost intrusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now began a life for Hedrick which may be rather painfully but
      truthfully likened to a prolongation of the experiences of a rat that
      finds itself in the middle of a crowded street in daylight: there is
      plenty of excitement but no pleasure. He was pursued, harried, hounded
      from early morning till nightfall, and even in his bed would hear shrill
      shouts go down the sidewalk from the throats of juvenile fly-by-nights:
      &ldquo;Oh dar-ling lit-oh darling lit-oh <i>lit</i>-le boy, <i>lit</i>-le
      boy, kiss me some <i>more</i>!&rdquo; And one day he overheard a remark
      which strengthened his growing conviction that the cataclysm had affected
      the whole United States: it was a teacher who spoke, explaining to another
      a disturbance in the hall of the school. She said, behind her hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He kissed an idiot</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura had not even remotely foreseen the consequences of her revelation,
      nor, indeed, did she now properly estimate their effect upon Hedrick. She
      and her mother were both sorry for him, and did what they could to
      alleviate his misfortunes, but there was an inevitable remnant of
      amusement in their sympathy. Youth, at war, affects stoicism but not
      resignation: in truth, resignation was not much in Hedrick&rsquo;s line,
      and it would be far from the fact to say that he was softened by his
      sufferings. He brooded profoundly and his brightest thought was revenge.
      It was not upon Cora that his chief bitterness turned. Cora had always
      been the constant, open enemy: warfare between them was a regular
      condition of life; and unconsciously, and without &ldquo;thinking it out,&rdquo;
      he recognized the naturalness of her seizing upon the deadliest weapon
      against him that came to her hand. There was nothing unexpected in that:
      no, the treachery, to his mind, lay in the act of Laura, that
      non-combatant, who had furnished the natural and habitual enemy with this
      scourge. At all times, and with or without cause, he ever stood ready to
      do anything possible for the reduction of Cora&rsquo;s cockiness, but now
      it was for the taking-down of Laura and the repayment of her uncalled-for
      and overwhelming assistance to the opposite camp that he lay awake nights
      and kept his imagination hot. Laura was a serene person, so neutral&mdash;outwardly,
      at least&mdash;and so little concerned for herself in any matter he could
      bring to mind, that for purposes of revenge she was a difficult
      proposition. And then, in a desperate hour, he remembered her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once had he glimpsed it, but she had shown unmistakable agitation of
      a mysterious sort as she wrote in it, and, upon observing his presence, a
      prompt determination to prevent his reading a word of what she had
      written. Therefore, it was something peculiarly sacred and intimate. This
      deduction was proved by the care she exercised in keeping the book
      concealed from all eyes. A slow satisfaction began to permeate him: he
      made up his mind to find that padlocked ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He determined with devoted ardour that when he found it he would make the
      worst possible use of it: the worst, that is, for Laura. As for
      consequences to himself, he was beyond them. There is an Irish play in
      which an old woman finds that she no longer fears the sea when it has
      drowned the last of her sons; it can do nothing more to her. Hedrick no
      longer feared anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book was somewhere in Laura&rsquo;s room, he knew that; and there were
      enough opportunities to search, though Laura had a way of coming in
      unexpectedly which was embarrassing; and he suffered from a sense of
      inadequacy when&mdash;on the occasion of his first new attempt&mdash;he
      answered the casual inquiry as to his presence by saying that he &ldquo;had
      a headache.&rdquo; He felt there was something indirect in the reply; but
      Laura was unsuspicious and showed no disposition to be analytical. After
      this, he took the precaution to bring a school-book with him and she often
      found the boy seated quietly by her west window immersed in study: he said
      he thought his headaches came from his eyes and that the west light
      &ldquo;sort of eased them a little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The ledger remained undiscovered, although probably there has never been a
      room more thoroughly and painstakingly searched, without its floor being
      taken up and its walls torn down. The most mysterious, and, at the same
      time, the most maddening thing about it was the apparent simplicity of the
      task. He was certain that the room contained the book: listening,
      barefooted, outside the door at night, he had heard the pen scratching.
      The room was as plain as a room can be, and small. There was a scantily
      filled clothes-press; he had explored every cubic inch of it. There was
      the small writing table with one drawer; it held only some note-paper and
      a box of pen-points. There was a bureau; to his certain knowledge it
      contained no secret whatever. There were a few giltless chairs, and a
      white &ldquo;wash-stand,&rdquo; a mere basin and slab with exposed
      plumbing. Lastly, there was the bed, a very large and ugly &ldquo;Eastlake&rdquo;
      contrivance; he had acquired a close acquaintance with all of it except
      the interior of the huge mattress itself, and here, he finally concluded,
      must of necessity be the solution. The surface of the mattress he knew to
      be unbroken; nevertheless the book was there. He had recently stimulated
      his deductive powers with a narrative of French journalistic sagacity in a
      similar case; and he applied French reasoning. The ledger existed. It was
      somewhere in the room. He had searched everything except the interior of
      the mattress. The ledger was in that interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exploration thus become necessary presented some difficulties.
      Detection in the act would involve explanations hard to invent; it would
      not do to say he was looking for his knife; and he could not think of any
      excuse altogether free from a flavour of insincerity. A lameness beset
      them all and made them liable to suspicion; and Laura, once suspicious,
      might be petty enough to destroy the book, and so put it out of his power
      forever. He must await the right opportunity, and, after a racking
      exercise of patience, at last he saw it coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Sloane had permitted his patient to come down stairs for an
      increasing interval each day. Mr. Madison crept, rather than walked,
      leaning upon his wife and closely attended by Miss Peirce. He spoke with
      difficulty and not clearly; still, there was a perceptible improvement,
      and his family were falling into the habit of speaking of him as almost
      well. On that account, Mrs. Madison urged her daughters to accept an
      invitation from the mother of the once courtly Egerton Villard. It was at
      breakfast that the matter was discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course Cora must go,&rdquo; Laura began, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nothing!&rdquo; interrupted Cora. &ldquo;How would it look if I
      went and you didn&rsquo;t? Everybody knows papa&rsquo;s almost well, and
      they&rsquo;d think it silly for us to give up the first real dance since
      last spring on that account; yet they&rsquo;re just spiteful enough, if I
      went and you stayed home, to call me a `girl of no heart.&rsquo; Besides,&rdquo;
      she added sweetly, &ldquo;we ought to go to show Mrs. Villard we aren&rsquo;t
      hurt because Egerton takes so little notice of poor Hedrick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick&rsquo;s lips moved silently, as in prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; said Laura. &ldquo;I doubt if I&rsquo;d
      have a very good time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would, too,&rdquo; returned her sister, decidedly. &ldquo;The
      men like to dance with you; you dance every bit as well as I do, and that
      black lace is the most becoming dress you ever had. Nobody ever remembers
      a black dress, anyway, unless it&rsquo;s cut very conspicuously, and yours
      isn&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t go without you; they love to say nasty things
      about me, and you&rsquo;re too good a sister to give 'em this chance, you
      old dear.&rdquo; She laughed and nodded affectionately across the table at
      Laura. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it would be nicer,&rdquo; said the mother. And so it was
      settled. It was simultaneously settled in Hedrick&rsquo;s mind that the
      night of the dance should mark his discovery of the ledger. He would have
      some industrious hours alone with the mysterious mattress, safe from
      intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meekly he lifted his eyes from his plate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re
      going, sister Laura,&rdquo; he said in a gentle voice. &ldquo;I think a
      change will do you good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful,&rdquo; exclaimed Cora, appealing to the
      others to observe him, &ldquo;what an improvement a disappointment in love
      can make in deportment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For once, Hedrick only smiled.

    <p>
      Laura had spent some thoughtful hours upon her black lace dress with
      results that astonished her family: it became a ball-gown&mdash;and a
      splendidly effective one. She arranged her dark hair in a more elaborate
      fashion than ever before, in a close coronal of faintly lustrous braids;
      she had no jewellery and obviously needed none. Her last action but one
      before she left her room was to dispose of the slender chain and key she
      always wore round her neck; then her final glance at the mirror&mdash;which
      fairly revealed a lovely woman&mdash;ended in a deprecatory little &ldquo;face&rdquo;
      she made at herself. It meant: &ldquo;Yes, old lady, you fancy yourself
      very passable in here all by yourself, don&rsquo;t you? Just wait: you&rsquo;ll
      be standing beside Cora in a moment!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And when she did stand beside Cora, in the latter&rsquo;s room, a moment
      later, her thought seemed warranted. Cora, radiant-eyed, in high bloom,
      and exquisite from head to foot in a shimmering white dancing-dress, a
      glittering crescent fastening the silver fillet that bound her vivid hair,
      was a flame of enchantment. Mrs. Madison, almost weeping with delight, led
      her daughters proudly, an arm round the waist of each, into her husband&rsquo;s
      room. Propped with pillows, he reclined in an armchair while Miss Peirce
      prepared his bed, an occupation she gave over upon this dazzling entrance,
      departing tactfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at these,&rdquo; cried the mother; &ldquo;&mdash;from our
      garden, Jim, dear! Don&rsquo;t we feel rich, you and I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;Laura,&rdquo; said the sick man, with the slow
      and imperfect enunication caused by his disease; &ldquo;Laura looks pretty&mdash;too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she adorable!&rdquo; Cora exclaimed warmly. &ldquo;She
      decided to be the portrait of a young duchess, you see, all stately
      splendour&mdash;made of snow and midnight!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; laughed Laura; but she blushed with pleasure,
      and taking Cora&rsquo;s hand in hers lifted it to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you see Cora&rsquo;s crescent?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Madison.
      &ldquo;What do you think of <i>that</i> for magnificence? She went down
      town this morning with seven dollars, and came back with that and her
      party gloves and a dollar in change! Isn&rsquo;t she a bargainer? Even for
      rhinestones they are the cheapest things you ever heard of. They look
      precisely like stones of the very finest water.&rdquo; They did&mdash;so
      precisely, indeed, that if the resemblance did not amount to actual
      identity, then had a jeweller of the town been able to deceive the eye of
      Valentine Corliss, which was an eye singularly learned in such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re&mdash;both smart girls,&rdquo; said Madison, &ldquo;both
      of them. And they look&mdash;beautiful, to-night&mdash;both. Laura is&mdash;amazing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had gone, Mrs. Madison returned from the stairway, and, kneeling
      beside her husband, put her arms round him gently: she had seen the tear
      that was marking its irregular pathway down his flaccid, gray cheek, and
      she understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t worry, Jim,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Those
      bright, beautiful things!&mdash;aren&rsquo;t they treasures?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s Laura,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Cora will
      be all right. She looks out for&mdash;herself. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      afraid for&mdash;Laura. Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid for
      either of them.&rdquo; But she was: the mother had always been afraid for
      Cora.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . At the dance, the two girls, attended up the stairway to the
      ballroom by a chattering covey of black-coats, made a sensational entrance
      to a gallant fanfare of music, an effect which may have been timed to the
      premonitory tuning of instruments heard during the ascent; at all events,
      it was a great success; and Cora, standing revealed under the wide gilt
      archway, might have been a lithe and shining figure from the year
      eighteen-hundred-and-one, about to dance at the Luxembourg. She placed her
      hand upon the sleeve of Richard Lindley, and, glancing intelligently over
      his shoulder into the eyes of Valentine Corliss, glided rhythmically away.
    </p>
    <p>
      People looked at her; they always did. Not only the non-dancers watched
      her; eyes everywhere were upon her, even though the owners gyrated, glided
      and dipped on distant orbits. The other girls watched her, as a rule, with
      a profound, an almost passionate curiosity; and they were prompt to speak
      well of her to men, except in trustworthy intimacy, because they did not
      enjoy being wrongfully thought jealous. Many of them kept somewhat aloof
      from her; but none of them ever nowadays showed &ldquo;superiority&rdquo;
      in her presence, or snubbed her: that had been tried and proved disastrous
      in rebound. Cora never failed to pay her score&mdash;and with a terrifying
      interest added, her native tendency being to take two eyes for an eye and
      the whole jaw for a tooth. They let her alone, though they asked and asked
      among themselves the never-monotonous question: &ldquo;Why do men fall in
      love with girls like that?&rdquo; a riddle which, solved, makes wives
      condescending to their husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the people at this dance had known one another as friends, or
      antagonists, or indifferent acquaintances, for years, and in such an
      assembly there are always two worlds, that of the women and that of the
      men. Each has its own vision, radically different from that of the other;
      but the greatest difference is that the men are unaware of the other
      world, only a few of them&mdash;usually queer ones like Ray Vilas&mdash;vaguely
      perceiving that there are two visions, while all the women understand both
      perfectly. The men splash about on the surface; the women keep their eyes
      open under water. Or, the life of the assembly is like a bright tapestry:
      the men take it as a picture and are not troubled to know how it is
      produced; but women are weavers. There was a Beauty of far-flung renown at
      Mrs. Villard&rsquo;s to-night: Mary Kane, a creature so made and coloured
      that young men at sight of her became as water and older men were apt to
      wonder regretfully why all women could not have been made like Mary. She
      was a kindly soul, and never intentionally outshone her sisters; but the
      perfect sumptuousness of her had sometimes tried the amiability of Cora
      Madison, to whom such success without effort and without spark seemed
      unfair, as well as bovine. Miss Kane was a central figure at the dance,
      shining tranquilly in a new triumph: that day her engagement had been
      announced to Mr. George Wattling, a young man of no special attainments,
      but desirable in his possessions and suitable to his happiness. The pair
      radiated the pardonable, gay importance of newly engaged people, and Cora,
      who had never before bestowed any notice upon Mr. Wattling, now examined
      him with thoughtful attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding him at her elbow in a group about a punch bowl, between dances,
      she offered warm felicitations. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t suppose you care
      whether <i>I</i> care for you to be happy or not,&rdquo; she added, with a
      little plaintive laugh;&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve always hated me so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wattling was startled: never before had he imagined that Cora Madison
      had given him a thought; but there was not only thought, there was
      feeling, in this speech. She seemed to be concealing with bravery an even
      deeper feeling than the one inadvertently expressed. &ldquo;Why, what on
      earth makes you think that?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think it? I <i>know</i> it!&rdquo; She gave him a strange look,
      luminous yet mysterious, a curtain withdrawn only to show a shining mist
      with something undefined but dazzling beyond. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always
      known it!&rdquo; And she turned away from him abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang after her. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re wrong. I&rsquo;ve never&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you have.&rdquo; They began to discuss it, and for better
      consideration of the theme it became necessary for Cora to &ldquo;cut&rdquo;
      the next dance, promised to another, and to give it to Mr. Wattling. They
      danced several times together, and Mr. Wattling&rsquo;s expression was
      serious. The weavers of the tapestry smiled and whispered things the men
      would not have understood&mdash;nor believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ray Vilas, seated alone in a recessed and softly lighted gallery, did not
      once lose sight of the flitting sorceress. With his elbows on the railing,
      he leaned out, his head swaying slowly and mechanically as she swept up
      and down the tumultuously moving room, his passionate eyes gaunt and
      brilliant with his hunger. And something very like a general thrill passed
      over the assembly when, a little later, it was seen that he was dancing
      with her. Laura, catching a glimpse of this couple, started and looked
      profoundly disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extravagance of Vilas&rsquo;s passion and the depths he sounded, in
      his absurd despair when discarded, had been matters of almost public
      gossip; he was accounted a somewhat scandalous and unbalanced but
      picturesque figure; and for the lady whose light hand had wrought such
      havoc upon him to be seen dancing with him was sufficiently startling to
      elicit the universal remark&mdash;evidently considered superlative&mdash;that
      it was &ldquo;just like Cora Madison!&rdquo; Cora usually perceived, with
      an admirably clear head, all that went on about her; and she was conscious
      of increasing the sensation, when after a few turns round the room, she
      allowed her partner to conduct her to a secluding grove of palms in the
      gallery. She sank into the chair he offered, and, fixing her eyes upon a
      small lamp of coloured glass which hung overhead, ostentatiously looked
      bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your feet, Cora,&rdquo; he said, seating himself upon a stool,
      and leaning toward her. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it appropriate that we should
      talk to music&mdash;we two? It shouldn&rsquo;t be that quick step though&mdash;not
      dance-music&mdash;should it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know &lsquo;m sure,&rdquo; murmured Cora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were kind to dance with me,&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;I
      dared to speak to you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not change her attitude nor the direction of her glance. &ldquo;I
      couldn&rsquo;t cut you very well with the whole town looking on. I&rsquo;m
      tired of being talked about. Besides, I don&rsquo;t care much who I dance
      with&mdash;so he doesn&rsquo;t step on me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is the prelude to `L&rsquo;Arlesienne&rsquo;
      that they should play for you and me. Yes, I think it should be that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a rustic tragedy, the story of a boy in the south
      of France who lets love become his whole life, and then&mdash;it kills
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds very stupid,&rdquo; she commented languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People do sometimes die of love, even nowadays,&rdquo; he said,
      tremulously&mdash;&ldquo;in the South.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She let her eyes drift indifferently to him and perceived that he was
      trembling from head to foot; that his hands and knees shook piteously;
      that his lips quivered and twitched; and, at sight of this agitation, an
      expression of strong distaste came to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Her eyes returned to the lamp. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      from the South, and of course it&rsquo;s going to kill you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t speak the exact words you had in your mind.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what words did I have `in my mind&rsquo;?&rdquo; she asked
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you really meant was: `If it does kill you, what of it?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and sighed as for release.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora,&rdquo; he said huskily, &ldquo;I understand you a little
      because you possess me. I&rsquo;ve never&mdash;literally never&mdash;had
      another thought since the first time I saw you: nothing but you. I think
      of you&mdash;actually every moment. Drunk or sober, asleep or&mdash;awake,
      it&rsquo;s nothing but you, you, <i>you</i>! It will never be different: I
      don&rsquo;t know why I can&rsquo;t get over it&mdash;I only know I can&rsquo;t.
      You own me; you burn like a hot coal in my heart. You&rsquo;re through
      with me, I know. You drained me dry. You&rsquo;re like a child who eats so
      heartily of what he likes that he never touches it again. And I&rsquo;m a
      dish you&rsquo;re sick of. Oh, it&rsquo;s all plain enough, I can tell
      you. I&rsquo;m not exciting any more&mdash;no, just a nauseous slave!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want people to hear you?&rdquo; she inquired angrily, for
      his voice had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tempered his tone. &ldquo;Cora, when you liked me you went a pretty
      clipping gait with me,&rdquo; he said, trembling even more than before.
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re infinitely more infatuated with this Toreador of a
      Corliss than you were with me; you&rsquo;re lost in him; you&rsquo;re
      slaving for him as I would for you. How far are you going with&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to walk away and leave you?&rdquo; she asked,
      suddenly sitting up straight and looking at him with dilating eyes.
      &ldquo;If you want a `scene&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; he said, more calmly. &ldquo;I know now how
      dangerous the man is. Of course you will tell him I said that.&rdquo; He
      laughed quietly. &ldquo;Well&mdash;between a dangerous chap and a
      desperate one, we may look for some lively times! Do you know, I believe I
      think about as continuously of him, lately, as I do of you. That&rsquo;s
      why I put almost my last cent into his oil company, and got what may be
      almost my last dance with you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call it `almost&rsquo; your last dance with me!&rdquo;
      she returned icily. &ldquo;Not after what you&rsquo;ve said. I had a
      foolish idea you could behave&mdash;well, at least decently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Corliss tell you that I insulted him in his rooms at the hotel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; She laughed, genuinely. &ldquo;I see him letting you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did, however. By manner and in speech I purposely and
      deliberately insulted him. You&rsquo;ll tell him every word of this, of
      course, and he&rsquo;ll laugh at it, but I give myself the pleasure of
      telling you. I put the proposition of an `investment&rsquo; to him in a
      way nobody not a crook would have allowed to be smoothed over&mdash;and he
      allowed it to be smoothed over. He ate it! I felt he was a swindler when
      he was showing Richard Lindley his maps and papers, and now I&rsquo;ve
      proved it to myself, and it&rsquo;s worth the price.&rdquo; Often, when
      they had danced, and often during this interview, his eyes lifted
      curiously to the white flaming crescent in her hair; now they fixed
      themselves upon it, and in a flash of divination he cried: &ldquo;You wear
      it for me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not understand. &ldquo;Finished raving?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave Corliss a thousand dollars,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;Considering
      the fact that it was my last, I flatter myself it was not unhandsomely
      done&mdash;though I may never need it. It has struck me that the sum was
      about what a man who had just cleaned up fifty thousand might regard as a
      sort of `extra&rsquo;&mdash;`for lagniappe&rsquo;&mdash;and that he might
      have thought it an appropriate amount to invest in a present some jewels
      perhaps&mdash;to place in the hair of a pretty friend!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet, furious, but he stood in front of her and was able
      to bar the way for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora, I&rsquo;ll have a last word with you if I have to hold you,&rdquo;
      he said with great rapidity and in a voice which shook with the intense
      repression he was putting upon himself. &ldquo;We do one thing in the
      South, where I came from. We protect our women&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This looks like it! Keeping me when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said, his face whiter than she had ever seen
      it. &ldquo;I love you! I&rsquo;m your dog! You take care of yourself if
      you want to take care of anybody else! As sure as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dance, Miss Madison.&rdquo; A young gentleman on vacation from
      the navy had approached, and, with perfect unconsciousness of what he was
      interrupting, but with well-founded certainty that he was welcome to the
      lady, urged his claim in a confident voice. &ldquo;I thought it would
      never come, you know; but it&rsquo;s here at last and so am I.&rdquo; He
      laughed propitiatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ray yielded now at once. She moved him aside with her gloved forearm as if
      he were merely an awkward stranger who unwittingly stood between her and
      the claiming partner. Carrying the gesture farther, she took the latter&rsquo;s
      arm, and smilingly, and without a backward glance, passed onward and left
      the gallery. The lieutenant, who had met her once or twice before, was her
      partner for the succeeding dance as well, and, having noted the advantages
      of the place where he had discovered her, persuaded her to return there to
      sit through the second. Then without any fatiguing preamble, he proposed
      marriage. Cora did not accept, but effected a compromise, which, for the
      present, was to consist of an exchange of photographs (his to be in
      uniform) and letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was having an evening to her heart. Ray&rsquo;s attack on Corliss had
      no dimming effect; her thought of it being that she was &ldquo;used to his
      raving&rdquo;; it meant nothing; and since Ray had prophesied she would
      tell Corliss about it, she decided not to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The naval young gentleman and Valentine Corliss were the greatest of all
      the lions among ladies that night; she had easily annexed the lieutenant,
      and Corliss was hers already; though, for a purpose, she had not yet been
      seen in company with him. He was visibly &ldquo;making an impression.&rdquo;
      His name, as he had said to Richard Lindley, was held in honour in the
      town; and there was a flavour of fancied romance in his absence since
      boyhood in unknown parts, and his return now with a `foreign air&rsquo;
      and a bow that almost took the breath of some of the younger recipients.
      He was, too, in his way, the handsomest man in the room; and the smiling,
      open frankness of his look, the ready cordiality of his manner, were found
      very winning. He caused plenty of flutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora waited till the evening was half over before she gave him any visible
      attention. Then, during a silence of the music, between two dances, she
      made him a negligent sign with her hand, the gesture of one indifferently
      beckoning a creature who is certain to come, and went on talking casually
      to the man who was with her. Corliss was the length of the room from her,
      chatting gayly with a large group of girls and women; but he immediately
      nodded to her, made his bow to individuals of the group, and crossed the
      vacant, glistening floor to her. Cora gave him no greeting whatever; she
      dismissed her former partner and carelessly turned away with Corliss to
      some chairs in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo; asked Vilas, leaning over the balcony
      railing with Richard Lindley. &ldquo;Look! She&rsquo;s showing the other
      girls&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see? He&rsquo;s the New Man; she let &rsquo;em
      hope she wasn&rsquo;t going in for him; a lot of them probably didn&rsquo;t
      even know that she knew him. She sent him out on parade till they&rsquo;re
      all excited about him; now she shows &rsquo;em he&rsquo;s entirely her
      property&mdash;and does it so matter-of-factly that it&rsquo;s rubbed in
      twice as hard as if she seemed to take some pains about it. He doesn&rsquo;t
      dance: she&rsquo;ll sit out with him now, till they all read the tag she&rsquo;s
      put on him. She says she hates being talked about. She lives on it!&mdash;so
      long as it&rsquo;s envious. And did you see her with that chap from the
      navy? Neptune thinks he&rsquo;s dallying with Venus perhaps, but he&rsquo;ll
      get&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lindley looked at him commiseratingly. &ldquo;I think I never saw prettier
      decorations. Have you noticed, Ray? Must have used a thousand
      chrysanthemums.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toreador!&rdquo; whispered the other between his teeth, looking at
      Corliss; then, turning to his companion, he asked: &ldquo;Has it occurred
      to you to get any information about Basilicata, or about the ancestral
      domain of the Moliterni, from our consul-general at Naples?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard hesitated. &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes. Yes, I did think of that. Yes, I
      thought of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That is, I haven&rsquo;t yet. You see, Corliss explained to me
      that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend interrupted him with a sour laugh. &ldquo;Oh, certainly! He&rsquo;s
      one of the greatest explainers ever welcomed to our city!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard said mildly: &ldquo;And then, Ray, once I&rsquo;ve gone into a
      thing I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like to seem suspicious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Dick!&rdquo; returned Vilas compassionately. &ldquo;You
      kind, easy, sincere men are so conscientiously untruthful with yourselves.
      You know in your heart that Cora would be furious with you if you seemed
      suspicious, and she&rsquo;s been so nice to you since you put in your
      savings to please her, that you can&rsquo;t bear to risk offending her.
      She&rsquo;s twisted you around her little finger, and the unnamed fear
      that haunts you is that you won&rsquo;t be allowed to stay there&mdash;even
      twisted!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty decorations, Ray,&rdquo; said Richard; but he grew very red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; asked Ray, regarding him
      keenly, &ldquo;if this Don Giovanni from Sunny It&rsquo; is shown up as a
      plain get-rich-quick swindler?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t considered&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would do precisely,&rdquo; said Ray, &ldquo;nothing! Cora&rsquo;d
      see to that. You&rsquo;d sigh and go to work again, beginning at the
      beginning where you were years ago, and doing it all over. Admirable
      resignation, but not for me! I&rsquo;m a stockholder in his company and in
      shape to `take steps&rsquo;! I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d be patient
      enough to make them legal&mdash;perhaps I should. He may be safe on the
      legal side. I&rsquo;ll know more about that when I find out if there is a
      Prince Moliterno in Naples who owns land in Basilicata.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t doubt it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt everything! In this particular matter I&rsquo;ll have less
      to doubt when I get an answer from the consul-general. <i>I</i>&rsquo;ve
      written, you see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lindley looked disturbed. &ldquo;You have?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Vilas read him at a glance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid to find out!&rdquo;
      he cried. Then he set his hand on the other&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;If
      there ever was a God&rsquo;s fool, it&rsquo;s you, Dick Lindley. Really, I
      wonder the world hasn&rsquo;t kicked you around more than it has; you&rsquo;d
      never kick back! You&rsquo;re as easy as an old shoe. Cora makes you
      unhappy,&rdquo; he went on, and with the very mention of her name, his
      voice shook with passion,&mdash;&ldquo;but on my soul I don&rsquo;t
      believe you know what jealousy means: you don&rsquo;t even understand
      hate; you don&rsquo;t eat your heart&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and eat something better,&rdquo; suggested Richard,
      laughing. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a continuous supper downstairs and I hear
      it&rsquo;s very good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ray smiled, rescued for a second from himself. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
      anything better than your heart, you old window-pane, and I&rsquo;m glad
      you don&rsquo;t eat it. And if I ever mix it up with Don Giovanni T.
      Corliss&mdash;`T&rsquo; stands for Toreador&mdash;I do believe it&rsquo;ll
      be partly on your&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, leaving the sentence
      unfinished, as his attention was caught by the abysmal attitude of a
      figure in another part of the gallery: Mr. Wade Trumble, alone in a
      corner, sitting upon the small of his small back, munching at an unlighted
      cigar and otherwise manifesting a biting gloom. Ray drew Lindley&rsquo;s
      attention to this tableau of pain. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a three of us!&rdquo;
      he said. He turned to look down into the rhythmic kaleidoscope of dancers.
      &ldquo;And there goes the girl we all <i>ought</i> to be morbid about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura Madison. Why aren&rsquo;t we? What a self-respecting creature
      she is, with that cool, sweet steadiness of hers&mdash;she&rsquo;s like a
      mountain lake. She&rsquo;s lovely and she plays like an angel, but so far
      as anybody&rsquo;s ever thinking about her is concerned she might almost
      as well not exist. Yet she&rsquo;s really beautiful to-night, if you can
      manage to think of her except as a sort of retinue for Cora.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She <i>is</i> rather beautiful to-night. Laura&rsquo;s always a
      very nice-looking girl,&rdquo; said Richard, and with the advent of an
      idea, he added: &ldquo;I think one reason she isn&rsquo;t more conspicuous
      and thought about is that she is so quiet,&rdquo; and, upon his companion&rsquo;s
      greeting this inspiration with a burst of laughter, &ldquo;Yes, that was a
      brilliant deduction,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I do think she&rsquo;s
      about the quietest person I ever knew. I&rsquo;ve noticed there are times
      when she&rsquo;ll scarcely speak at all for half an hour, or even more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not precisely noisy yourself,&rdquo; said Ray. &ldquo;Have
      you danced with her this evening?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; returned the other, in a tone which showed this
      omission to be a discovery; &ldquo;not yet. I must, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s really `rather&rsquo; beautiful. Also, she dances
      `rather&rsquo; better than any other girl in town. Go and perform your
      painful duty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; said Richard thoughtfully, not
      perceiving the satire. &ldquo;At any rate, I&rsquo;ll ask her for the
      next.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He found it unengaged. There came to Laura&rsquo;s face an April change as
      he approached, and she saw he meant to ask her to dance. And, as they swam
      out into the maelstrom, he noticed it, and remarked that it <i>was</i>
      rather warm, to which she replied by a cheerful nod. Presently there came
      into Richard&rsquo;s mind the thought that he was really an excellent
      dancer; but he did not recall that he had always formed the same pleasing
      estimate of himself when he danced with Laura, nor realize that other
      young men enjoyed similar self-help when dancing with her. And yet he
      repeated to her what Ray had said of her dancing, and when she laughed as
      in appreciation of a thing intended humorously, he laughed, too, but
      insisted that she did dance &ldquo;very well indeed.&rdquo; She laughed
      again at that, and they danced on, not talking. He had no sense of &ldquo;guiding&rdquo;
      her; there was no feeling of effort whatever; she seemed to move
      spontaneously with his wish, not to his touch; indeed, he was not sensible
      of touching her at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Laura,&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly, &ldquo;you dance <i>beautifully</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stumbled and almost fell; saved herself by clutching at his arm; he
      caught her; and the pair stopped where they were, in the middle of the
      floor. A flash of dazed incredulity from her dark eyes swept him; there
      was something in it of the child dodging an unexpected blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I trip you?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she laughed, quickly, and her cheeks grew even redder.
      &ldquo;I tripped myself. Wasn&rsquo;t that too bad&mdash;just when you
      were thinking that I danced well! Let&rsquo;s sit down. May we?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to some chairs against a wall. There, as they sat, Cora swung by
      them, dancing again with her lieutenant, and looking up trancedly into the
      gallant eyes of the triumphant and intoxicated young man. Visibly, she was
      a woman with a suitor&rsquo;s embracing arm about her. Richard&rsquo;s
      eyes followed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Laura in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to speak out loud,&rdquo; she said tremulously.
      &ldquo;But I meant: don&rsquo;t look so troubled. It doesn&rsquo;t mean
      anything at all&mdash;her coquetting with that bird of passage. He&rsquo;s
      going away in the morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I was troubling about that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whatever it was&rdquo;&mdash;she paused, and laughed with a
      plaintive timidity&mdash;&ldquo;why, just don&rsquo;t trouble about it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I look very much troubled?&rdquo; he asked seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And you don&rsquo;t look very gay when you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo;
      She laughed with more assurance now. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re always
      the wistfulest looking man I ever saw.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody laughs at me, I believe,&rdquo; he said, with continued
      seriousness. &ldquo;Even Ray Vilas thinks I&rsquo;m an utter fool. Am I,
      do <i>you</i> think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned as he spoke and glanced inquiringly into her eyes. What he saw
      surprised and dismayed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t cry!&rdquo; he whispered
      hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent her head, turning her face from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been very hopeful lately,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Cora
      has been so kind to me since I did what she wanted me to, that I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      He gave a deep sigh. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re <i>that</i> sorry for me,
      my chances with her must be pretty desperate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not alter her attitude, but with her down-bent face still away
      from him, said huskily: &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t you I&rsquo;m sorry for. You
      mustn&rsquo;t ever give up; you must keep on trying and trying. If you
      give up, I don&rsquo;t know what will become of her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later she rose suddenly to her feet. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s finish
      our dance,&rdquo; she said, giving him her hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I
      won&rsquo;t stumble again.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER SIXTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two girls let themselves into the house noiselessly, and, turning out
      the hall-light, left for them by their mother, crept upstairs on tiptoe;
      and went through the upper hall directly to Laura&rsquo;s room&mdash;Cora&rsquo;s
      being nearer the sick-room. At their age it is proper that a gayety be
      used three times: in anticipation, and actually, and in after-rehearsal.
      The last was of course now in order: they went to Laura&rsquo;s room to
      &ldquo;talk it over.&rdquo; There was no gas-fixture in this small
      chamber; but they found Laura&rsquo;s oil-lamp burning brightly upon her
      writing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How queer!&rdquo; said Laura with some surprise, as she closed the
      door. &ldquo;Mother never leaves the lamp lit for me; she&rsquo;s always
      so afraid of lamps exploding.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Miss Peirce came in here to read, and forgot to turn it
      out,&rdquo; suggested Cora, seating herself on the edge of the bed and
      letting her silk wrap fall from her shoulders. &ldquo;Oh, Laura, wasn&rsquo;t
      he gorgeous. . . .&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She referred to the gallant defender of our seas, it appeared, and while
      Laura undressed and got into a wrapper, Cora recounted in detail the
      history of the impetuous sailor&rsquo;s enthrallment;&mdash;a resume
      predicted three hours earlier by a gleeful whisper hissed across the
      maritime shoulder as the sisters swung near each other during a waltz:
      &ldquo;<i>proposed</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always heard they&rsquo;re horribly inconstant,&rdquo;
      she said, regretfully. &ldquo;But, oh, Laura, wasn&rsquo;t he beautiful to
      look at! Do you think he&rsquo;s more beautiful than Val? No&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      tell me if you do. I don&rsquo;t want to hear it! Val was so provoking: he
      didn&rsquo;t seem to mind it at all. He&rsquo;s nothing but a big brute
      sometimes: he wouldn&rsquo;t even admit that he minded, when I asked him.
      I was idiot enough to ask; I couldn&rsquo;t help it; he was so tantalizing
      and exasperating&mdash;laughing at me. I never knew anybody like him; he&rsquo;s
      so sure of himself and he can be so cold. Sometimes I wonder if he really
      cares about anything, deep down in his heart&mdash;anything except
      himself. He seems so selfish: there are times when he almost makes me hate
      him; but just when I get to thinking I do, I find I don&rsquo;t&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      so deliciously strong, and there&rsquo;s such a <i>big</i> luxury in being
      understood: I always feel he <i>knows</i> me clear to the bone, somehow!
      But, oh,&rdquo; she sighed regretfully, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t a uniform
      become a man? They ought to all wear &rsquo;em. It would look silly on
      such a little goat as that Wade Trumble, though: nothing could make him
      look like a whole man. Did you see him glaring at me? Beast! I was going
      to be so nice and kittenish and do all my prettiest tricks for him, to
      help Val with his oil company. Val thinks Wade would come in yet, if I&rsquo;D
      only get him in the mood to have another talk with Val about it; but the
      spiteful little rat wouldn&rsquo;t come near me. I believe that was one of
      the reasons Val laughed at me and pretended not to mind my getting
      proposed to. He <i>must</i> have minded; he couldn&rsquo;t have helped
      minding it, really. That&rsquo;s his way; he&rsquo;s so <i>mean</i>&mdash;he
      won&rsquo;t show things. He knows <i>me</i>. I can&rsquo;t keep anything
      from him; he reads <i>me</i> like a signboard; and then about himself he
      keeps me guessing, and I can&rsquo;t tell when I&rsquo;ve guessed right.
      Ray Vilas behaved disgustingly, of course; he was horrid and awful. I
      might have expected it. I suppose Richard was wailing <i>his</i> tiresome
      sorrows on your poor shoulder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Laura. &ldquo;He was very cheerful. He seemed glad
      you were having a good time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t look particularly cheerful at me. I never saw so
      slow a man: I wonder when he&rsquo;s going to find out about that pendant.
      Val would have seen it the instant I put it on. And, oh, Laura! isn&rsquo;t
      George Wattling funny? He&rsquo;s just <i>soft</i>! He&rsquo;s
      good-looking though,&rdquo; she continued pensively, adding, &ldquo;I
      promised to motor out to the Country Club with him to-morrow for tea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cora,&rdquo; protested Laura, &ldquo;no! Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve promised; so I&rsquo;ll have to, now.&rdquo; Cora
      laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do Mary Kane good. Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to
      bother much with <i>him</i>&mdash;he makes me tired. I never saw anything
      so complacent as that girl when she came in to-night, as if her little
      Georgie was the greatest capture the world had ever seen. . . .&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She chattered on. Laura, passive, listened with a thoughtful expression,
      somewhat preoccupied. The talker yawned at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be after three,&rdquo; she said, listlessly, having gone
      over her evening so often that the colours were beginning to fade. She
      yawned again. &ldquo;Laura,&rdquo; she remarked absently, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      see how you can sleep in this bed; it sags so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never noticed it,&rdquo; said her sister. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      a very comfortable old bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora went to her to be unfastened, reverting to the lieutenant during the
      operation, and kissing the tire-woman warmly at its conclusion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      always so sweet to me, Laura,&rdquo; she said affectionately. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know how you manage it. You&rsquo;re so good&rdquo;&mdash;she laughed&mdash;&ldquo;sometimes
      I wonder how you stand me. If I were you, I&rsquo;m positive I couldn&rsquo;t
      stand me at all!&rdquo; Another kiss and a hearty embrace, and she picked
      up her wrap and skurried silently through the hall to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very late, but Laura wrote for almost an hour in her book (which
      was undisturbed) before she felt drowsy. Then she extinguished the lamp,
      put the book away and got into bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost as if she had attempted to lie upon the empty air: the
      mattress sagged under her weight as if it had been a hammock; and
      something tore with a ripping sound. There was a crash, and a choked yell
      from a muffled voice somewhere, as the bed gave way. For an instant, Laura
      fought wildly in an entanglement of what she insufficiently perceived to
      be springs, slats and bedclothes with something alive squirming
      underneath. She cleared herself and sprang free, screaming, but even in
      her fright she remembered her father and clapped her hand over her mouth
      that she might keep from screaming again. She dove at the door, opened it,
      and fled through the hall to Cora&rsquo;s room, still holding her hand
      over her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora! Oh, Cora!&rdquo; she panted, and flung herself upon her
      sister&rsquo;s bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora was up instantly; and had lit the gas in a trice. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      a burglar!&rdquo; Laura contrived to gasp. &ldquo;In my room! Under the
      bed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fell on him! Something&rsquo;s the matter with the bed. It broke.
      I fell on him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora stared at her wide-eyed. &ldquo;Why, it can&rsquo;t be. Think how
      long I was in there. Your bed broke, and you just thought there was some
      one there. You imagined it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; wailed Laura. &ldquo;I <i>heard</i> him: he gave
      a kind of dreadful grunt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sure</i>? He wriggled&mdash;oh! I could <i>feel</i> him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora seized a box of matches again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; protested Laura, cowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am. If there&rsquo;s a burglar in the house I&rsquo;m going
      to find him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t wake papa.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor mamma either. You stay here if you want to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call Hedrick,&rdquo; suggested the pallid Laura;
      &ldquo;or put our heads out of the window and scream for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora laughed; she was not in the least frightened. &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t
      wake papa, of course! If we had a telephone I&rsquo;d send for the police;
      but we haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m going to see if there&rsquo;s any one
      there. A burglar&rsquo;s a man, I guess, and I can&rsquo;t imagine myself
      being afraid of any <i>man</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura clung to her, but Cora shook her off and went through the hall
      undaunted, Laura faltering behind her. Cora lighted matches with a
      perfectly steady hand; she hesitated on the threshold of Laura&rsquo;s
      room no more than a moment, then lit the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura stifled a shriek at sight of the bed. &ldquo;Look, look!&rdquo; she
      gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one under it now, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo;
      said Cora, and boldly lifted a corner of it. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s been
      cut all to pieces from underneath! You&rsquo;re right; there was some one
      here. It&rsquo;s practically dismembered. Don&rsquo;t you remember my
      telling you how it sagged? And I was only sitting on the edge of it! The
      slats have all been moved out of place, and as for the mattress, it&rsquo;s
      just a mess of springs and that stuffing stuff. He must have thought the
      silver was hidden there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo; moaned Laura. &ldquo;He <i>wriggled</i>&mdash;&mdash;ugh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora picked up the lamp. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to go over the house&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! I&rsquo;ll go alone then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>can&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, though!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls had changed places in this emergency. In her fright Laura
      was dependent, clinging: actual contact with the intruder had unnerved
      her. It took all her will to accompany her sister upon the tour of
      inspection, and throughout she cowered behind the dauntless Cora. It was
      the first time in their lives that their positions had been reversed. From
      the days of Cora&rsquo;s babyhood, Laura had formed the habit of petting
      and shielding the little sister, but now that the possibility became
      imminent of confronting an unknown and dangerous man, Laura was so shaken
      that, overcome by fear, she let Cora go first. Cora had not boasted in
      vain of her bravery; in truth, she was not afraid of any man.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found the fastenings of the doors secure and likewise those of all
      the windows, until they came to the kitchen. There, the cook had left a
      window up, which plausibly explained the marauder&rsquo;s mode of ingress.
      Then, at Cora&rsquo;s insistence, and to Laura&rsquo;s shivering horror,
      they searched both cellar and garret, and concluded that he had escaped by
      the same means. Except Laura&rsquo;s bed, nothing in the house had been
      disturbed; but this eccentricity on the part of a burglar, though it
      indeed struck the two girls as peculiar, was not so pointedly mysterious
      to them as it might have been had they possessed a somewhat greater
      familiarity with the habits of criminals whose crimes are professional.
    </p>
    <p>
      They finally retired, Laura sleeping with her sister, and Cora had begun
      to talk of the lieutenant again, instead of the burglar, before Laura fell
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the short hours for sleep, both girls appeared at the
      breakfast-table before the meal was over, and were naturally pleased with
      the staccato of excitement evoked by their news. Mrs. Madison and Miss
      Peirce were warm in admiration of their bravery, but in the same breath
      condemned it as foolhardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew such wonderful girls!&rdquo; exclaimed the mother,
      almost tearfully. &ldquo;You crazy little lions! To think of your not even
      waking Hedrick! And you didn&rsquo;t have even a poker and were in your
      bare feet&mdash;and went down in the <i>cellar</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all Cora,&rdquo; protested Laura. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
      hopeless, disgusting coward. I never knew what a coward I was before. Cora
      carried the lamp and went ahead like a drum-major. I just trailed along
      behind her, ready to shriek and run&mdash;or faint!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you tell anything about him when you fell on him?&rdquo;
      inquired Miss Peirce. &ldquo;What was his voice like when he shouted?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choked. It was a horrible, jolted kind of cry. It hardly sounded
      human.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you tell anything about whether he was a large man, or small,
      or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that he seemed very active. He seemed to be kicking. He <i>wriggled</i>&mdash;&mdash;ugh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They evolved a plausible theory of the burglar&rsquo;s motives and line of
      reasoning. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Miss Peirce, much stirred, in
      summing up the adventure, &ldquo;he either jimmies the window, or finds it
      open already, and Sarah&rsquo;s mistaken and she <i>did</i> leave it open!
      Then he searched the downstairs first, and didn&rsquo;t find anything.
      Then he came upstairs, and was afraid to come into any of the rooms where
      we were. He could tell which rooms had people in them by hearing us
      breathing through the keyholes. He finds two rooms empty, and probably he
      made a thorough search of Miss Cora&rsquo;s first. But he isn&rsquo;t
      after silver toilet articles and pretty little things like that. He wants
      really big booty or none, so he decides that an out-of-the-way,
      unimportant room like Miss Laura&rsquo;s is where the family would be most
      apt to hide valuables, jewellery and silver, and he knows that mattresses
      have often been selected as hiding-places; so he gets under the bed and
      goes to work. Then Miss Cora and Miss Laura come in so quietly&mdash;not
      wanting to wake anybody&mdash;that he doesn&rsquo;t hear them, and he gets
      caught there. That&rsquo;s the way it must have been.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; Mrs. Madison inquired of this authority, &ldquo;why
      do you suppose he lit the lamp?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see by,&rdquo; answered the ready Miss Peirce. It was accepted
      as final.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further discussion was temporarily interrupted by the discovery that
      Hedrick had fallen asleep in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother him, Cora,&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      finished eating&mdash;let him sleep a few minutes, if he wants to, before
      he goes to school. He&rsquo;s not at all well. He played too hard,
      yesterday afternoon, and hurt his knee, he said. He came down limping this
      morning and looking very badly. He oughtn&rsquo;t to run and climb about
      the stable so much after school. See how utterly exhausted he looks!&mdash;Not
      even this excitement can keep him awake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we must be careful not to let Mr. Madison suspect anything
      about the burglar,&rdquo; said Miss Peirce. &ldquo;It would be bad for
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura began: &ldquo;But we ought to notify the police&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Police!&rdquo; Hedrick woke so abruptly, and uttered the word with
      such passionate and vehement protest, that everybody started. &ldquo;I
      suppose you want to <i>kill</i> your father, Laura Madison!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose he wouldn&rsquo;t know something had happened with a
      squad of big, heavy policemen tromping all over the house? The first thing
      they&rsquo;d do would be to search the whole place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Mrs. Madison quickly. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t
      do at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not! I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; continued Hedrick,
      truthfully, &ldquo;<i>that</i> idea&rsquo;s out of your head! I believe
      Laura imagined the whole thing anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you looked at her mattress,&rdquo; inquired Cora, &ldquo;darling
      little boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a concentrated look, and rose to leave. &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;
      on earth but imagina&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped with a grunt as he
      forgetfully put his weight on his left leg. He rubbed his knee, swallowed
      painfully, and, leaving the word unfinished, limped haughtily from the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the house, gloomily swinging his books from a spare length of
      strap, and walking with care to ease his strains and bruises as much as
      possible. He was very low in his mind, that boy. His fortunes had reached
      the ebb-tide, but he had no hope of a rise. He had no hope of anything. It
      was not even a consolation that, through his talent for surprise in
      waylayings, it had lately been thought necessary, by the Villard family,
      to have Egerton accompanied to and from school by a man-servant. Nor was
      Hedrick more deeply depressed by the certainty that both public and
      domestic scandal must soon arise from the inevitable revelation of his
      discontinuing his attendance at school without mentioning this important
      change of career at home. He had been truant a full fortnight, under
      brighter circumstances a matter for a lawless pride&mdash;now he had
      neither fear nor vainglory. There was no room in him for anything but
      dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked two blocks in the direction of his school; turned a corner;
      walked half a block; turned north in the alley which ran parallel to
      Corliss Street, and a few moments later had cautiously climbed into an
      old, disused refuse box which stood against the rear wall of the empty
      stable at his own home. He pried up some loose boards at the bottom of the
      box, and entered a tunnel which had often and often served in happier days&mdash;when
      he had friends&mdash;for the escape of Union officers from Libby Prison
      and Andersonville. Emerging, wholly soiled, into a box-stall, he crossed
      the musty carriage house and ascended some rickety steps to a long vacant
      coachman&rsquo;s-room, next to the hayloft. He closed the door, bolted it,
      and sank moodily upon a broken, old horsehair sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      This apartment was his studio. In addition to the sofa, it contained an
      ex-bureau, three chair-like shapes, a once marble-topped table, now
      covered with a sheet of zinc, two empty bird cages, and a condemned
      whatnot. The walls were rather over-decorated in coloured chalks, the
      man-headed-snake motive predominating; they were also loopholed for firing
      into the hayloft. Upon the table lay a battered spy-glass, minus lenses,
      and, nearby, two boxes, one containing dried corn-silk, the other hayseed,
      convenient for the making of amateur cigarettes; the smoker&rsquo;s outfit
      being completed by a neat pile of rectangular clippings from newspapers.
      On the shelves of the whatnot were some fragments of a dead pie, the
      relics of a &ldquo;Fifteen-Puzzle,&rdquo; a pink Easter-egg, four
      seashells, a tambourine with part of a girl&rsquo;s face still visible in
      aged colours, about two thirds of a hot-water bag, a tintype of Hedrick,
      and a number of books: several by Henty, &ldquo;Twenty Thousand Leagues
      Under the Sea,&rdquo; &ldquo;100 Practical Jokes, Easy to Perform,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;The Jungle Book,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Lady Rotha,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Family
      Atlas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Three Weeks,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;A Boy&rsquo;s Life in Camp,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Mystery of the
      Count&rsquo;s Bedroom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gloomy eye of Hedrick wandered to &ldquo;The Mystery of the Count&rsquo;s
      Bedroom,&rdquo; and remained fixed upon it moodily and contemptuously. His
      own mystery made that one seem tame and easy: Laura&rsquo;s bedroom laid
      it all over the Count&rsquo;s, in his conviction; and with a soul too
      weary of pain to shudder, he reviewed the bafflements and final
      catastrophe of the preceding night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not essayed the attempt upon the mattress until assured that the
      house was wrapped in slumber. Then, with hope in his heart, he had stolen
      to Laura&rsquo;s room, lit the lamp, feeling safe from intrusion, and set
      to work. His implement at first was a long hatpin of Cora&rsquo;s. Lying
      on his back beneath the bed, and, moving the slats as it became necessary,
      he sounded every cubic inch of the mysterious mattress without
      encountering any obstruction which could reasonably be supposed to be the
      ledger. This was not more puzzling than it was infuriating, since by all
      processes of induction, deduction, and pure logic, the thing was
      necessarily there. It was nowhere else. Therefore it was there. It <i>had</i>
      to be there! With the great blade of his Boy Scout&rsquo;s knife he began
      to disembowel the mattress.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time he had worked furiously and effectively, but the position was
      awkward, the search laborious, and he was obliged to rest frequently.
      Besides, he had waited to a later hour than he knew, for his mother to go
      to bed, and during one of his rests he incautiously permitted his eyes to
      close. When he woke, his sisters were in the room, and he thought it
      advisable to remain where he was, though he little realized how he had
      weakened his shelter. When Cora left the room, he heard Laura open the
      window, sigh, and presently a tiny clinking and a click set him a-tingle
      from head to foot: she was opening the padlocked book. The scratching
      sound of a pen followed. And yet she had not come near the bed. The
      mattress, then, was a living lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      With infinite caution he had moved so that he could see her, arriving at a
      coign of vantage just as she closed the book. She locked it, wrapped it in
      an oilskin cover which lay beside it on the table, hung the key-chain
      round her neck, rose, yawned, and, to his violent chagrin, put out the
      light. He heard her moving but could not tell where, except that it was
      not in his part of the room. Then a faint shuffling warned him that she
      was approaching the bed, and he withdrew his head to avoid being stepped
      upon. The next moment the world seemed to cave in upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s flight had given him opportunity to escape to his own room
      unobserved; there to examine, bathe and bind his wounds, and to rectify
      his first hasty impression that he had been fatally mangled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick glared at &ldquo;The Mystery of the Count&rsquo;s Bedroom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by he got up, brought the book to the sofa and began to read it
      over.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The influence of a familiar and sequestered place is not only soothing;
      the bruised mind may often find it restorative. Thus Hedrick, in his
      studio, surrounded by his own loved bric-a-brac, began to feel once more
      the stir of impulse. Two hours&rsquo; reading inspired him. What a French
      reporter (in the Count&rsquo;s bedroom) could do, an American youth in
      full possession of his powers&mdash;except for a strained knee and other
      injuries&mdash;could do. Yes, and would!
    </p>
    <p>
      He evolved a new chain of reasoning. The ledger had been seen in Laura&rsquo;s
      room; it had been heard in her room; it appeared to be kept in her room.
      But it was in no single part of the room. All the parts make a whole.
      Therefore, the book was not in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Laura had not left the room when she took the book from
      its hiding-place. This was confusing; therefore he determined to
      concentrate logic solely upon what she had done with the ledger when she
      finished writing in it. It was dangerous to assume that she had restored
      it to the place whence she obtained it, because he had already proved that
      place to be both in the room and out of the room. No; the question he must
      keep in was: What did she do with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura had not left the room. But the book had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at this inevitable deduction, he sprang to his feet in a state of
      repressed excitement and began to pace the floor&mdash;like a hound on the
      trail. Laura had not left the room, but the book had left the room: he
      must keep his mind upon this point. He uttered a loud exclamation and
      struck the zinc table-top a smart blow with his clenched fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura had thrown the book out of the window!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the exaltation of this triumph, he forgot that it was not yet the hour
      for a scholar&rsquo;s reappearance, and went forth in haste to search the
      ground beneath the window&mdash;a disappointing quest, for nowhere in the
      yard was there anything but withered grass, and the rubbish of other
      frost-bitten vegetation. His mother, however, discovered something else,
      and, opening the kitchen window, she asked, with surprise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Hedrick, what on earth are you doing here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; inquired Hedrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here?&rdquo; Evidently she puzzled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became emphatic. &ldquo;I want to know what you are doing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just standing here,&rdquo; he explained in a meek, grieved way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why aren&rsquo;t you at school?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This recalled what he had forgotten, and he realized the insecurity of his
      position. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;school. Did you ask
      me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you go to school?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to speak rapidly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I go to <i>school</i>?
      Well, where else could I go? Just because I&rsquo;m here now doesn&rsquo;t
      mean I didn&rsquo;t <i>go</i>, does it? Because a person is in China right
      now wouldn&rsquo;t have to mean he&rsquo;d never been in South America,
      would it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was going along, and you know I didn&rsquo;t feel very well
      and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, with the advent of a happier idea,
      then continued briskly: &ldquo;But that didn&rsquo;t stop me, because I
      thought I ought to go if I dropped, so I went ahead, but the teacher was
      sick and they couldn&rsquo;t get a substitute. She must have been pretty
      sick, she looked so pale&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They dismissed the class?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t have to go to-morrow either.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;But if you feel ill, Hedrick,
      hadn&rsquo;t you better come in and lie down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s kind of passing off. The fresh air seems to be
      doing me good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful of your sore knee, dear.&rdquo; She closed the window,
      and he was left to continue his operations in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura had thrown the ledger out of the window; that was proved absolutely.
      Obviously, she had come down before daylight and retrieved it. Or, she had
      not. Proceeding on the assumption that she had not, he lifted his eyes and
      searched the air. Was it possible that the book, though thrown from the
      window, had never reached the ground? The branches of an old and stalwart
      maple, now almost divested of leaves, extended in rough symmetry above
      him, and one big limb, reaching out toward the house, came close to Laura&rsquo;s
      windows. Triumph shown again from the shrewd countenance of the sleuth:
      Laura must have slid the ledger along a wire into a hollow branch.
      However, no wire was to be seen&mdash;and the shrewd countenance of the
      sleuth fell. But perhaps she had constructed a device of silk threads,
      invisible from below, which carried the book into the tree. Action!
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed carefully but with many twinges, finally pausing in a parlous
      situation not far from the mysterious window which Laura had opened the
      night before. A comprehensive survey of the tree revealed only the very
      patent fact that none of the branches was of sufficient diameter to
      conceal the ledger. No silk threads came from the window. He looked and
      looked and looked at that window; then his eye fell a little, halted less
      than three feet below the window-ledge, and the search was ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen window which his mother had opened was directly beneath Laura&rsquo;s,
      and was a very long, narrow window, in the style of the house, and there
      was a protecting stone ledge above it. Upon this ledge lay the book,
      wrapped in its oil-skin covering and secured from falling by a piece of
      broken iron hooping, stuck in the mortar of the bricks. It could be seen
      from nowhere save an upper window of the house next door, or from the tree
      itself, and in either case only when the leaves had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura had felt very safe. No one had ever seen the book except that night,
      early in August, when, for a better circulation of air, she had left her
      door open as she wrote, and Hedrick had come upon her. He had not spoken
      of it again; she perceived that he had forgotten it; and she herself
      forgot that the memory of a boy is never to be depended on; its
      forgettings are too seldom permanent in the case of things that ought to
      stay forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the book one had only to lean from the window.

      Hedrick seemed so ill during lunch that his mother spoke of asking Doctor
      Sloane to look at him, if he did not improve before evening. Hedrick said
      meekly that perhaps that would be best&mdash;if he did not improve. After
      a futile attempt to eat, he courteously excused himself from the table&mdash;a
      ceremony which made even Cora fear that his case might be serious&mdash;and,
      going feebly to the library, stretched himself upon the sofa. His mother
      put a rug over him; Hedrick, thanking her touchingly, closed his eyes; and
      she went away, leaving him to slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time, Laura came into the room on an errand, walking noiselessly,
      and, noticing that his eyes were open, apologized for waking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he returned, in the tone of an invalid. &ldquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t sleep sound. I think there&rsquo;s something the matter
      inside my head: I have such terrible dreams. I guess maybe it&rsquo;s
      better for me to keep awake. I&rsquo;m kind of afraid to go to sleep.
      Would you mind staying here with me a little while?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I&rsquo;ll stay,&rdquo; she said, and, observing that his
      cheeks were flushed, and his eyes unusually bright, she laid a cool hand
      on his forehead. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any fever, dear; that&rsquo;s
      good. You&rsquo;ll be all right to-morrow. Would you like me to read to
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he answered, plaintively, &ldquo;reading might
      kind of disturb my mind: my brain feels so sort of restless and queer. I&rsquo;d
      rather play some kind of game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cards?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not cards exactly. Something&rsquo; I can do lying down. Oh, I
      know! You remember the one where we drew pictures and the others had to
      guess what they were? Well, I&rsquo;ve invented a game like that. You sit
      down at the desk over there and take some sheets of paper. I&rsquo;ll tell
      you the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed. &ldquo;What next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll describe some people and where they live and not
      tell who they are, and you see if you can guess their names and addresses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Addresses, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, because I&rsquo;m going to describe the way their houses look.
      Write each name on a separate sheet of paper, and the number of their
      house below it if you know it, and if you don&rsquo;t know it, just the
      street. If it&rsquo;s a woman: put `Miss&rsquo; or `Mrs.&rsquo; before
      their name and if it&rsquo;s a man write `Esquire&rsquo; after it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is all that necessary for the game?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way I invented it and I think you might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; she acquiesced, good-naturedly. &ldquo;It
      shall be according to your rules.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then afterward, you give me the sheets of paper with the names and
      addresses written on &rsquo;em, and we&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What do we do then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when we come to it.&rdquo; But when that stage
      of his invention was reached, and Laura had placed the inscribed sheets in
      his hand, his interest had waned, it appeared. Also, his condition had
      improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s quit. I thought this game would be more exciting,&rdquo;
      he said, sitting up. &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; he added with too much
      modesty, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very good at inventing games. I b&rsquo;lieve
      I&rsquo;ll go out to the barn; I think the fresh air&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel well enough to go out?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You do
      seem to be all right, though.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m a lot better, I think.&rdquo; He limped to the door.
      &ldquo;The fresh air will be the best thing for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not notice that he carelessly retained her contributions to the
      game, and he reached his studio with them in his hand. Hedrick had entered
      the &lsquo;teens and he was a reader: things in his head might have
      dismayed a Borgia.
    </p>
    <p>
      No remotest glimpse entered that head of the enormity of what he did. To
      put an end to his punishing of Cora, and, to render him powerless against
      that habitual and natural enemy, Laura had revealed a horrible incident in
      his career&mdash;it had become a public scandal; he was the sport of
      fools; and it might be months before the thing was lived down. Now he had
      the means, as he believed, to even the score with both sisters at a
      stroke. To him it was turning a tremendous and properly scathing joke upon
      them. He did not hesitate.

    <p>
      That evening, as Richard Lindley sat at dinner with his mother, Joe Varden
      temporarily abandoned his attendance at the table to answer the front
      doorbell. Upon his return, he remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messenger-boy mus&rsquo; been in big hurry. Wouldn&rsquo; wait till
      I git to door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy with package. Least, I reckon it were a boy. Call&rsquo; back
      from the front walk, say he couldn&rsquo; wait. Say he lef&rsquo; package
      in vestibule.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a package?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Middle-size kind o&rsquo; big package.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you see what it is, Richard?&rdquo; Mrs. Lindley
      asked of her son. &ldquo;Bring it to the table, Joe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was brought, Richard looked at the superscription with surprise.
      The wrapper was of heavy brown paper, and upon it a sheet of white
      notepaper had been pasted, with the address:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Richard Lindley, Esq.,
      1218 Corliss Street.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Laura Madison,&rdquo; he said, staring at this
      writing. &ldquo;What in the world would Laura be sending me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might possibly learn by opening it,&rdquo; suggested his
      mother. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen men puzzle over the outside of things quite
      as often as women. Laura Madison is a nice girl.&rdquo; She never
      volunteered similar praise of Laura Madison&rsquo;s sister. Mrs. Lindley
      had submitted to her son&rsquo;s plans concerning Cora, lately confided;
      but her submission lacked resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a book,&rdquo; said Richard, even more puzzled, as he
      took the ledger from its wrappings. &ldquo;Two little torn places at the
      edge of the covers. Looks as if it had once had clasps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s the Madison family album,&rdquo; Mrs. Lindley
      suggested. &ldquo;Pictures of Cora since infancy. I imagine she&rsquo;s
      had plenty taken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He opened the book and glanced at the pages covered in
      Laura&rsquo;s clear, readable hand. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s about half full
      of writing. Laura must have turned literary.&rdquo; He read a line or two,
      frowning mildly. &ldquo;My soul! I believe it&rsquo;s a novel! She must
      think I&rsquo;m a critic&mdash;to want me to read it.&rdquo; Smiling at
      the idea, he closed the ledger. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it upstairs to my
      hang-out after dinner, and see if Laura&rsquo;s literary manner has my
      august approval. Who in the world would ever have thought she&rsquo;d
      decide to set up for a writer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine she might have something to write worth reading,&rdquo;
      said his mother. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought she was an
      interesting-looking girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is. She dances well, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Lindley, thoughtfully, &ldquo;she
      seldom <i>says</i> anything interesting, but that may be because she so
      seldom has a chance to say anything at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard refused to perceive this allusion. &ldquo;Curious that Laura
      should have sent it to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s never seemed
      interested in my opinion about anything. I don&rsquo;t recall her ever
      speaking to me on any subject whatever&mdash;except one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned his attention to his plate, but his mother did not appear to
      agree with him that the topic was exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;`Except one&rsquo;?&rdquo; she repeated, after waiting for some
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, in his habitual preoccupied and casual
      tone. &ldquo;Or perhaps two. Not more than two, I should say&mdash;and in
      a way you&rsquo;d call that only one, of course. Bread, Joe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What two, Richard?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora,&rdquo; he said, with gentle simplicity, &ldquo;and me.&rdquo;
    </p>

      CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lindley had arranged for her son a small apartment on the second
      floor, and it was in his own library and smoking-room that Richard,
      comfortable in a leather-chair by a reading-lamp, after dinner, opened
      Laura&rsquo;s ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first page displayed no more than a date now eighteen months past, and
      the line:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Love came to me to-day.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The next page was dated the next day, and, beneath, he read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was all I <i>could</i> write, yesterday. I think I was too
      excited to write. Something seemed to be singing in my breast. I couldn&rsquo;t
      think in sentences&mdash;not even in words. How queer it is that I had
      decided to keep a diary, and bound this book for it, and now the first
      thing I have written in it was <i>that</i>! It will not be a diary. It
      shall be <i>your</i> book. I shall keep it sacred to You and write to You
      in it. How strange it will be if the day ever comes when I shall show it
      to You! If it should, you would not laugh at it, for of course the day
      couldn&rsquo;t come unless you understood. I cannot think it will ever
      come&mdash;that day! But maybe&mdash;&mdash; No, I mustn&rsquo;t let
      myself hope too much that it will, because if I got to hoping too much,
      and you didn&rsquo;t like me, it would hurt too much. People who expect
      nothing are never disappointed&mdash;I must keep that in mind. Yet <i>every</i>
      girl has a <i>right</i> to hope for her own man to come for her some time,
      hasn&rsquo;t she? It&rsquo;s not easy to discipline the wanting to hope&mdash;since
      <i>yesterday</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I must always have thought a great deal about you without
      knowing it. We really know so little what we think: our minds are going on
      all the time and we hardly notice them. It is like a queer sort of factory&mdash;the
      owner only looks in once in a while and most of the time hasn&rsquo;t any
      idea what sort of goods his spindles are turning out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw You yesterday! It seems to me the strangest thing in the
      world. I&rsquo;ve seen you by chance, probably two or three times a month
      nearly all my life, though you so seldom come here to call. And this time
      wasn&rsquo;t different from dozens of other times&mdash;you were just
      standing on the corner by the Richfield, waiting for a car. The only
      possible difference is that you had been out of town for several months&mdash;Cora
      said so this morning&mdash;and how ridiculous it seems now, didn&rsquo;t
      even know it! I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it&mdash;not with the top part of my
      mind, but perhaps the deep part that does the real thinking had noticed it
      and had mourned your absence and was so glad to see you again that it made
      the top part suddenly see the wonderful truth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lindley set down the ledger to relight his cigar. It struck him that Laura
      had been writing &ldquo;very odd Stuff,&rdquo; but interesting; and
      certainly it was not a story. Vaguely he recalled Marie Bashkirtseff: hadn&rsquo;t
      she done something like this? He resumed the reading:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You turned and spoke to me in that lovely, cordial, absent-minded
      way of yours&mdash;though I&rsquo;d never thought (with the top part) what
      a lovely way it was; and for a moment I only noticed how nice you looked
      in a light gray suit, because I&rsquo;d only seen you in black for so
      long, while you&rsquo;d been in mourning for your brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard, disturbed by an incredible idea, read these last words over and
      then dismissed the notion as nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;. . . While you&rsquo;d been in mourning for your brother&mdash;and
      it struck me that light gray was becoming to you. Then such a queer thing
      happened: I felt the great kindness of your eyes. I thought they were full
      of&mdash;the only word that seems to express it at all is <i>charity</i>&mdash;and
      they had a sweet, faraway look, too, and I&rsquo;ve <i>always</i> thought
      that a look of wistful kindness was the loveliest look in the world&mdash;and
      you had it, and I saw it and then suddenly, as you held your hat in your
      hand, the sunshine on your hair seemed brighter than any sunshine I had
      ever seen&mdash;and I began to tremble all over. I didn&rsquo;t understand
      what was the matter with me or what had made me afraid with you not of you&mdash;all
      at once, but I was so hopelessly rattled that instead of waiting for the
      car, as I&rsquo;d just told you I meant to, I said I&rsquo;d decided to
      walk, and got away&mdash;without any breath left to breathe with! I <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>
      have gotten on the car with you&mdash;- and I couldn&rsquo;t have spoken
      another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as I walked home, trembling all the way, I saw that strange,
      dazzling sunshine on your hair, and the wistful, kind look in your eyes&mdash;you
      seemed not to have taken the car but to have come with me&mdash;and I was
      uplifted and exalted oh, so strangely&mdash;oh, how the world was changing
      for me! And when I got near home, I began to walk faster, and on the front
      path I broke into a run and rushed in the house to the piano&mdash;and it
      was as if my fingers were thirsty for the keys! Then I saw that I was
      playing to you and knew that I loved you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How different everything is now from everything before. Music means
      what it never did: Life has leaped into blossom for me. Everywhere there
      is colour and radiance that I had never seen&mdash;the air is full of
      perfume. Dear, the sunshine that fell upon your head has spread over the
      world!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, as I never understood, that the world&mdash;so
      dazzling to me now&mdash;was made for love and is meaningless without it.
      The years until yesterday are gray&mdash;no, not gray, because that was
      the colour You were wearing&mdash;not gray, because that is a beautiful
      colour. The empty years until yesterday had no colour at all. Yes, the
      world has meaning only through loving, and without meaning there is no
      real life. We live only by loving, and now that this gift of life has come
      to me I love <i>all</i> the world. I feel that I must be so kind, kind, <i>kind</i>
      to <i>everybody</i>! Such an odd thing struck me as my greatest wish. When
      I was little, I remember grandmother telling me how, when she was a child
      in pioneer days, the women made the men&rsquo;s clothes&mdash;homespun&mdash;and
      how a handsome young Circuit Rider, who was a bachelor, seemed to her the
      most beautifully dressed man she had ever seen. The women of the different
      churches made his clothes, as they did their husbands&rsquo; and brothers.&rsquo;
      you see&mdash;only better! It came into my head that that would be the
      divinest happiness that I could know&mdash;to sew for you! If you and I
      lived in those old, old times&mdash;you <i>look</i> as if you belonged to
      them, you know, dear&mdash;and You were the young minister riding into the
      settlement on a big bay horse&mdash;and all the girls at the window, of
      course!&mdash;and I sewing away at the homespun for you!&mdash;I think all
      the angels of heaven would be choiring in my heart&mdash;and what thick,
      warm clothes I&rsquo;d make you for winter! Perhaps in heaven they&rsquo;ll
      let some of the women sew for the men they love&mdash;I wonder!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear Cora&rsquo;s voice from downstairs as I write. She&rsquo;s
      often so angry with Ray, poor girl. It does not seem to me that she and
      Ray really belong to each other, though they <i>say</i> so often that they
      do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard having read thus far with a growing, vague uneasiness, looked up,
      frowning. He hoped Laura had no Marie Bashkirtseff idea of publishing this
      manuscript. It was too intimate, he thought, even if the names in it were
      to be disguised.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . &ldquo;Though they <i>say</i> so often that they do. I think Ray is
      in love with <i>her</i>, but it can&rsquo;t be like <i>this</i>. What he
      feels must be something wholly different&mdash;there is violence and
      wildness in it. And they are bitter with each other so often&mdash; always
      `getting even&rsquo; for something. He does care&mdash;he is frantically `<i>in</i>
      love&rsquo; with her, undoubtedly, but so insanely jealous. I suppose all
      jealousy is insane. But love is the only sanity. How can what is insane be
      part of it? I could not be jealous of You. I owe life to you&mdash;I have
      never lived till now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next writing was two days later:
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . &ldquo;To-day as I passed your house with Cora, I kept looking at
      the big front door at which you go in and out so often&mdash;<i>your</i>
      door! I never knew that just a door could look so beautiful! And
      unconsciously I kept my eyes on it, as we walked on, turning my head and
      looking and looking back at it, till Cora suddenly burst out laughing, and
      said: `Well, <i>Laura</i>!&rsquo; And I came to myself&mdash;and found her
      looking at me. It was like getting back after a journey, and for a second
      I was a little dazed, and Cora kept on laughing at me, and I felt myself
      getting red. I made some silly excuse about thinking your house had been
      repainted&mdash;and she laughed louder than ever. I was afraid then that
      she understood&mdash;I wonder if she could have? I hope not, though I love
      her so much I don&rsquo;t know why I would rather she didn&rsquo;t know,
      unless it is just my <i>feeling</i> about it. It is a <i>guardian</i>
      feeling&mdash;that I must keep for myself, the music of these angels
      singing in my heart&mdash;singing of You. I hope she did not understand&mdash;and
      I so fear she did. Why should I be so <i>afraid</i>?&rdquo; . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . &ldquo;Two days since I have talked to You in your book after Cora
      caught me staring at your door and laughed at me&mdash;and ten minutes ago
      I was sitting beside the <i>actual</i> You on the porch! I am trembling
      yet. It was the first time you&rsquo;d come for months and months; and yet
      you had the air of thinking it rather a pleasant thing to do as you came
      up the steps! And a dizzy feeling came over me, because I wondered if it
      was seeing me on the street <i>that</i> day that put it into your head to
      come. It seemed too much happiness&mdash;and risking too much&mdash;to let
      myself <i>believe</i> it, but I couldn&rsquo;t help just wondering. I
      began to tremble as I saw you coming up our side of the street in the
      moonlight&mdash;and when you turned in here I was all panic&mdash;I nearly
      ran into the house. I don&rsquo;t know how I found voice to greet you. I
      didn&rsquo;t seem to have any breath left at all. I was so relieved when
      Cora took a chair between us and began to talk to you, because I&rsquo;m
      sure I couldn&rsquo;t have. She and poor Ray had been having one of their
      quarrels and she was punishing him. Poor boy, he seemed so miserable&mdash;though
      he tried to talk to me&mdash;about politics, I think, though I&rsquo;m not
      sure, because I couldn&rsquo;t listen much better than either of us could
      talk. I could only hear Your voice&mdash;such a rich, quiet voice, and it
      has a sound like the look you have&mdash;friendly and faraway and wistful.
      I have thought and thought about what it is that makes you look wistful.
      You have less to wish for than anybody else in the world because you have
      Yourself. So why are you wistful? I think it&rsquo;s just because you <i>are</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard Cora asking you why you hadn&rsquo;t come to see us for so
      long, and then she said: `Is it because you dislike me? You look at me,
      sometimes, as if you dislike me!&rsquo; And I wished she hadn&rsquo;t said
      it. I had a feeling you wouldn&rsquo;t like that `personal&rsquo; way of
      talking that she enjoys&mdash;and that&mdash;oh, it didn&rsquo;t seem to
      be in keeping with the dignity of You! And I love Cora so much I wanted
      her to be finer&mdash;with You. I wanted her to understand you better than
      to play those little charming tricks at you. You are so good, so <i>high</i>,
      that if she could make a real friend of you I think it would be the best
      thing for her that could happen. She&rsquo;s never had a man-<i>friend</i>.
      Perhaps she <i>was</i> trying to make one of you and hasn&rsquo;t any
      other way to go about it. She can be so <i>really</i> sweet, I wanted you
      to see that side of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterwhile, when Ray couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer to talk to
      me, and in his desperation brazenly took Cora to the other end of the
      porch almost by force, and I was left, in a way, alone with you what did
      you think of me? I was tongue-tied! Oh, oh, oh! You were quiet&mdash;but
      <i>I</i> was <i>dumb</i>! My heart wasn&rsquo;t dumb&mdash;it hammered!
      All the time I kept saying to myself such a jumble of things. And into the
      jumble would come such a rapture that You were there&mdash;it was like a
      paean of happiness&mdash;a chanting of the glory of having You near me&mdash;I
      <i>was</i> mixed up! I could <i>play</i> all those confused things, but
      writing them doesn&rsquo;t tell it. Writing them would only be like this:
      `He&rsquo;s here, he&rsquo;s <i>here</i>! Speak, you little fool! He&rsquo;s
      here, he&rsquo;s here! He&rsquo;s sitting beside you! <i>speak</i>, idiot,
      or he&rsquo;ll never come back! He&rsquo;s here, he&rsquo;s beside you you
      could put out your hand and touch him! Are you dead, that you can&rsquo;t
      speak? He&rsquo;s here, he&rsquo;s here, he&rsquo;s <i>here</i>!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, some day I shall be able to talk to you&mdash;but not till I
      get more used to this inner song. It seems to <i>will</i> that nothing
      else shall come from my lips till <i>it</i> does!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of my silence&mdash;my outward woodenness&mdash;you said,
      as you went away, that you would come again! You said `soon&rsquo;! I
      could only nod but Cora called from the other end of the porch and asked:
      `<i>How</i> soon?&rsquo; Oh, I bless her for it, because you said, `Day
      after to-morrow.&rsquo; Day after tomorrow! Day after to-morrow! <i>Day
      after tomorrow</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . &ldquo;Twenty-one hours since I wrote&mdash;no, <i>sang</i>&mdash;`Day
      after to-morrow!&rsquo; And now it is `To-morrow!&rsquo; Oh, the slow,
      golden day that this has been! I could not stay in the house&mdash;I
      walked&mdash;no, I <i>winged</i>! I was in the open country before I knew
      it&mdash;with You! For You are in everything. I never knew the sky was
      blue, before. Until now I just thought it was the sky. The whitest clouds
      I ever saw sailed over that blue, and I stood upon the prow of each in
      turn, then leaped in and swam to the next and sailed with <i>it</i>! Oh,
      the beautiful sky, and kind, green woods and blessed, long, white, dusty
      country road! Never in my life shall I forget that walk&mdash;this day in
      the open with my love&mdash;You! To-morrow! To-morrow! To-morrow! <i>To-morrow</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next writing in Laura&rsquo;s book was dated more than two months
      later:
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . &ldquo;I have decided to write again in this book. I have thought
      it all out carefully, and I have come to the conclusion that it can do no
      harm and may help me to be steady and sensible. It is the thought, not its
      expression, that is guilty, but I do not believe that my thoughts are
      guilty: I believe that they are good. I know that I wish only good. I have
      read that when people suffer very much the best thing is for them to cry.
      And so I&rsquo;ll let myself <i>write</i> out my feelings&mdash;and
      perhaps get rid of some of the silly self-pity I&rsquo;m foolish enough to
      feel, instead of going about choked up with it. How queer it is that even
      when we keep our thoughts respectable we can&rsquo;t help having absurd <i>feelings</i>
      like self-pity, even though we know how rotten stupid they are! Yes, I&rsquo;ll
      let it all out here, and then, some day, when I&rsquo;ve cured myself all
      whole again, I&rsquo;ll burn this poor, silly old book. And if I&rsquo;m
      not cured before the wedding, I&rsquo;ll burn it then, anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How funny little girls are! From the time they&rsquo;re little bits
      of things they talk about marriage&mdash;whom they are going to marry,
      what sort of person it will be. I think Cora and I began when she was
      about five and I not seven. And as girls grow up, I don&rsquo;t believe
      there was ever one who genuinely expected to be an old maid. The most
      unattractive young girls discuss and plan and expect marriage just as much
      as the prettier and gayer ones. The only way we can find out that men don&rsquo;t
      want to marry us is by their not asking us. We don&rsquo;t see ourselves
      very well, and I honestly believe we all think&mdash;way deep down&mdash;that
      we&rsquo;re pretty attractive. At least, every girl has the idea,
      sometimes, that if men only saw the whole truth they&rsquo;d think her as
      nice as any other girl, and really nicer than most others. But I don&rsquo;t
      believe I have any hallucinations of that sort about myself left. I can&rsquo;t
      imagine&mdash;now&mdash;<i>any</i> man seeing anything in me that would
      make him care for me. I can&rsquo;t see anything about me to care for,
      myself. Sometimes I think maybe I could make a man get excited about me if
      I could take a startlingly personal tone with him from the beginning,
      making him wonder all sorts of you-and-I perhapses&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t
      do it very well probably&mdash;oh, I couldn&rsquo;t make myself do it if I
      could do it well! And I shouldn&rsquo;t think it would have much effect
      except upon very inexperienced men&mdash;yet it does! Now, I wonder if
      this is a streak of sourness coming out; I don&rsquo;t feel bitter&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      just thinking honestly, I&rsquo;m sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here I am facing it: all through my later childhood, and all
      through my girlhood, I believe what really occupied me most&mdash;with the
      thought of it underlying all things else, though often buried very deep&mdash;was
      the prospect of my marriage. I regarded it as a certainty: I would grow
      up, fall in love, get engaged, and be married&mdash;of course! So I grew
      up and fell in love with You&mdash;but it stops there, and I must learn
      how to be an Old Maid and not let anybody see that I mind it. I know this
      is the hardest part of it, the beginning: it will get easier by-and-by, of
      course. If I can just manage this part of it, it&rsquo;s bound not to hurt
      so much later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I grew up and fell in love with You&mdash;for you will always
      be You. I&rsquo;ll never, never get over <i>that</i>, my dear! You&rsquo;ll
      never, never know it; but I shall love You always till I die, and if I&rsquo;m
      still Me after that, I shall keep right on loving you then, of course. You
      see, I didn&rsquo;t fall in love with you just to have you for myself. I
      fell in love with You! And that can never bother you at all nor ever be a
      shame to me that I love unsought, because you won&rsquo;t know, and
      because it&rsquo;s just an ocean of good-will, and every beat of my heart
      sends a new great wave of it toward you and Cora. I shall find happiness,
      I believe, in service&mdash;I am sure there will be times when I can serve
      you both. I love you both and I can serve her for You and you for her.
      This isn&rsquo;t a hysterical mood, or a fit of `exaltation&rsquo;: I have
      thought it all out and I know that I can live up to it. You are the best
      thing that can ever come into her life, and everything I can do shall be
      to keep you there. I must be very, very careful with her, for talk and
      advice do not influence her much. You love her&mdash;she has accepted you,
      and it is beautiful for you both. It must be kept beautiful. It has all
      become so clear to me: You are just what she has always needed, and if by
      any mischance she lost you I do not know what would become&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Richard. He sprang to his feet, and the
      heavy book fell with a muffled crash upon the floor, sprawling open upon
      its face, its leaves in disorder. He moved away from it, staring at it in
      incredulous dismay. But he knew.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER NINETEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Memory, that drowsy custodian, had wakened slowly, during this hour,
      beginning the process with fitful gleams of semi-consciousness, then,
      irritated, searching its pockets for the keys and dazedly exploring blind
      passages; but now it flung wide open the gallery doors, and there, in
      clear light, were the rows of painted canvasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered &ldquo;that day&rdquo; when he was waiting for a car, and
      Laura Madison had stopped for a moment, and then had gone on, saying she
      preferred to walk. He remembered that after he got into the car he
      wondered why he had not walked home with her; had thought himself &ldquo;slow&rdquo;
      for not thinking of it in time to do it. There had seemed something very
      &ldquo;taking&rdquo; about her, as she stopped and spoke to him, something
      enlivening and wholesome and sweet&mdash;it had struck him that Laura was
      a &ldquo;very nice girl.&rdquo; He had never before noticed how really
      charming she could look; in fact he had never thought much about either of
      the Madison sisters, who had become &ldquo;young ladies&rdquo; during his
      mourning for his brother. And this pleasant image of Laura remained with
      him for several days, until he decided that it might be a delightful thing
      to spend an evening with her. He had called, and he remembered, now, Cora&rsquo;s
      saying to him that he looked at her sometimes as if he did not like her;
      he had been surprised and astonishingly pleased to detect a mysterious
      feeling in her about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that almost at once he had fallen in love with Cora: she
      captivated him, enraptured him, as she still did&mdash;as she always
      would, he felt, no matter how she treated him or what she did to him. He
      did not analyze the process of the captivation and enrapturement&mdash;for
      love is a mystery and cannot be analyzed. This is so well known that even
      Richard Lindley knew it, and did not try!
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . Heartsick, he stared at the fallen book. He was a man, and here was
      the proffered love of a woman he did not want. There was a pathos in the
      ledger; it seemed to grovel, sprawling and dishevelled in the circle of
      lamp-light on the floor: it was as if Laura herself lay pleading at his
      feet, and he looked down upon her, compassionate but revolted. He realized
      with astonishment from what a height she had fallen, how greatly he had
      respected her, how warmly liked her. What she now destroyed had been more
      important than he had guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simple masculine indignation rose within him: she was to have been his
      sister. If she had been unable to stifle this misplaced love of hers,
      could she not at least have kept it to herself? Laura, the
      self-respecting! No; she offered it&mdash;offered it to her sister&rsquo;s
      betrothed. She had written that he should &ldquo;never, never know it&rdquo;;
      that when she was &ldquo;cured&rdquo; she would burn the ledger. She had
      not burned it! There were inconsistencies in plenty in the pitiful screed,
      but these were the wildest&mdash;and the cheapest. In talk, she had urged
      him to &ldquo;keep trying,&rdquo; for Cora, and now the sick-minded
      creature sent him this record. She wanted him to know. Then what else was
      it but a plea? &ldquo;I love you. Let Cora go. Take me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to walk up and down, wondering what was to be done. After a time,
      he picked up the book gingerly, set it upon a shelf in a dark corner, and
      went for a walk outdoors. The night air seemed better than that of the
      room that held the ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner a boy, running, passed him. It was Hedrick Madison, but
      Hedrick did not recognize Richard, nor was his mind at that moment
      concerned with Richard&rsquo;s affairs; he was on an errand of haste to
      Doctor Sloane. Mr. Madison had wakened from a heavy slumber unable to
      speak, his condition obviously much worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick returned in the doctor&rsquo;s car, and then hung uneasily about
      the door of the sick-room until Laura came out and told him to go to bed.
      In the morning, his mother did not appear at the breakfast table, Cora was
      serious and quiet, and Laura said that he need not go to school that day,
      though she added that the doctor thought their father would get &ldquo;better.&rdquo;
      She looked wan and hollow-eyed: she had not been to bed, but declared that
      she would rest after breakfast. Evidently she had not missed her ledger;
      and Hedrick watched her closely, a pleasurable excitement stirring in his
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not go to her room after the meal; the house was cold, possessing
      no furnace, and, with Hedrick&rsquo;s assistance, she carried out the
      ashes from the library grate, and built a fire there. She had just lighted
      it, and the kindling was beginning to crackle, glowing rosily over her
      tired face, when the bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you see who it is, please, Hedrick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went with alacrity, and, returning, announced in an odd voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      Dick Lindley. He wants to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; she murmured, wanly surprised. She was kneeling before
      the fireplace, wearing an old dress which was dusted with ashes, and upon
      her hands a pair of worn-out gloves of her father&rsquo;s. Lindley
      appeared in the hall behind Hedrick, carrying under his arm something
      wrapped in brown paper. His expression led her to think that he had heard
      of her father&rsquo;s relapse, and came on that account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me, Richard,&rdquo; she said, smiling faintly
      as she rose, and stripping her hands of the clumsy gloves. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      good of you to come, though. Doctor Sloane thinks he is going to be better
      again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard inclined his head gravely, but did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hedrick with a slight emphasis, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll
      go out in the yard a while.&rdquo; And with shining eyes he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall, out of range from the library door, he executed a triumphant
      but noiseless caper, and doubled with mirth, clapping his hand over his
      mouth to stifle the effervescings of his joy. He had recognized the ledger
      in the same wrapping in which he had left it in Mrs. Lindley&rsquo;s
      vestibule. His moment had come: the climax of his enormous joke, the
      repayment in some small measure for the anguish he had so long endured. He
      crept silently back toward the door, flattened his back against the wall,
      and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; he heard Laura say, a vague alarm in her voice,
      &ldquo;what is it? What is the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Lindley: &ldquo;I did not know what to do about it. I couldn&rsquo;t
      think of any sensible thing. I suppose what I am doing is the stupidest of
      all the things I thought of, but at least it&rsquo;s honest&mdash;so I&rsquo;ve
      brought it back to you myself. Take it, please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a crackling of the stiff wrapping paper, a little pause, then a
      strange sound from Laura. It was not vocal and no more than just audible:
      it was a prolonged scream in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick ventured an eye at the crack, between the partly open door and its
      casing. Lindley stood with his back to him, but the boy had a clear view
      of Laura. She was leaning against the wall, facing Richard, the book
      clutched in both arms against her bosom, the wrapping paper on the floor
      at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of sending it back and pretending to think it had been
      left at my mother&rsquo;s house by mistake,&rdquo; said Richard sadly,
      &ldquo;and of trying to make it seem that I hadn&rsquo;t read any of it. I
      thought of a dozen ways to pretend I believed you hadn&rsquo;t really
      meant me to read it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Making a crucial effort, she managed to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;think I&mdash;did mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered, with a helpless shrug, &ldquo;you sent
      it! But it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in it that really matters, isn&rsquo;t it?
      I could have pretended anything in a note, I suppose, if I had written
      instead of coming. But I found that what I most dreaded was meeting you
      again, and as we&rsquo;ve got to meet, of course, it seemed to me the only
      thing to do was to blunder through a talk with you, somehow or another,
      and get that part of it over. I thought the longer I put off facing you,
      the worse it would be for both of us&mdash;and&mdash;and the more
      embarrassing. I&rsquo;m no good at pretending, anyhow; and the thing has
      happened. What use is there in not being honest? Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not try again to speak. Her state was lamentable: it was all in
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard hung his head wretchedly, turning partly away from her. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      only one way&mdash;to look at it,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly, and
      stammering. &ldquo;That is&mdash;there&rsquo;s only one thing to do: to
      forget that it&rsquo;s happened. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&mdash;oh, well, I care
      for Cora altogether. She&rsquo;s got never to know about this. She hasn&rsquo;t
      any idea or&mdash;suspicion of it, has she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura managed to shake her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never must have,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you promise me to
      burn that book now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Laura,&rdquo; he said brokenly.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not idiot enough not to see that you&rsquo;re suffering
      horribly. I suppose I have done the most blundering thing possible.&rdquo;
      He stood a moment, irresolute, then turned to the door. &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick had just time to dive into the hideous little room of the
      multitudinous owls as Richard strode into the hall. Then, with the closing
      of the front door, the boy was back at his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura stood leaning against the wall, the book clutched in her arms, as
      Richard had left her. Slowly she began to sink, her eyes wide open, and,
      with her back against the wall, she slid down until she was sitting upon
      the floor. Her arms relaxed and hung limp at her sides, letting the book
      topple over in her lap, and she sat motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of her feet protruded from her skirt, and the leaping firelight
      illumined it ruddily. It was a graceful foot in an old shoe which had been
      re-soled and patched. It seemed very still, that patched shoe, as if it
      might stay still forever. Hedrick knew that Laura had not fainted, but he
      wished she would move her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away. He went into the owl-room again, and stood there silently a
      long, long time. Then he stole back again toward the library door, but
      caught a glimpse of that old, motionless shoe through the doorway as he
      came near. Then he spied no more. He went out to the stable, and,
      secluding himself in his studio, sat moodily to meditate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something was the matter. Something had gone wrong. He had thrown a bomb
      which he had expected to go off with a stupendous bang, leaving him, as
      the smoke cleared, looking down in merry triumph, stinging his fallen
      enemies with his humour, withering them with satire, and inquiring of them
      how it felt, now <i>they</i> were getting it. But he was decidedly
      untriumphant: he wished Laura had moved her foot and that she hadn&rsquo;t
      that patch upon her shoe. He could not get his mind off that patch. He
      began to feel very queer: it seemed to be somehow because of the patch. If
      she had worn a pair of new shoes that morning. . . . Yes, it was that
      patch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirteen is a dangerous age: nothing is more subtle. The boy, inspired to
      play the man, is beset by his own relapses into childhood, and Hedrick was
      near a relapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by, he went into the house again, to the library. Laura was not
      there, but he found the fire almost smothered under heaping ashes. She had
      burned her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the room where the piano was, and played &ldquo;The Girl on
      the Saskatchewan&rdquo; with one finger; then went out to the porch and
      walked up and down, whistling cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, he went upstairs and asked Miss Peirce how his father was
      &ldquo;feeling,&rdquo; receiving a noncommital reply; looked in at Cora&rsquo;s
      room; saw that his mother was lying asleep on Cora&rsquo;s bed and Cora
      herself examining the contents of a dressing-table drawer; and withdrew. A
      moment later, he stood in the passage outside Laura&rsquo;s closed door
      listening. There was no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      He retired to his own chamber, found it unbearable, and, fascinated by
      Laura&rsquo;s, returned thither; and, after standing a long time in the
      passage, knocked softly on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura,&rdquo; he called, in a rough and careless voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      kind of a pretty day outdoors. If you&rsquo;ve had your nap, if I was you
      I&rsquo;d go out for a walk.&rdquo; There was no response. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      go with you,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if you want me to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened again and heard nothing. Then he turned the knob softly. The
      door was unlocked; he opened it and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was sitting in a chair, with her back to a window, her hands in her
      lap. She was staring straight in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came near her hesitatingly, and at first she did not seem to see him or
      even to know that she was not alone in the room. Then she looked at him
      wonderingly, and, as he stood beside her, lifted her right hand and set it
      gently upon his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hedrick,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was it you that took my book to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once he fell upon his knees, hid his face in her lap, and burst
      into loud and passionate sobbing.

      CHAPTER TWENTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Valentine Corliss, having breakfasted in bed at a late hour that morning,
      dozed again, roused himself, and, making a toilet, addressed to the image
      in his shaving-mirror a disgusted monosyllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ass!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he had not the look of a man who had played cards all night to a
      disastrous tune with an accompaniment in Scotch. His was a surface not
      easily indented: he was hard and healthy, clear-skinned and clear-eyed.
      When he had made himself point-device, he went into the &ldquo;parlour&rdquo;
      of his apartment, frowning at the litter of malodorous, relics, stumps and
      stubs and bottles and half-drained glasses, scattered chips and cards,
      dregs of a night session. He had been making acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat at the desk and wrote with a steady hand in Italian:
    </p>
    <h3>
      MOST ILLUSTRIOUS MOLITERNO:
    </h3>
    <p>
      We live but learn little. As to myself it appears that I learn nothing&mdash;nothing!
      You will at once convey to me by <i>cable</i> five thousand lire. No; add
      the difference in exchange so as to make it one thousand dollars which I
      shall receive, taking that sum from the two-hundred and thirty thousand
      lire which I entrusted to your safekeeping by cable as the result of my
      enterprise in this place. I should have returned at once, content with
      that success, but as you know I am a very stupid fellow, never pleased
      with a moderate triumph, nor with a large one, when there is a possible
      prospect of greater. I am compelled to believe that the greater I had in
      mind in this case was an illusion: my gentle diplomacy avails nothing
      against a small miser&mdash;for we have misers even in these States,
      though you will not believe it. I abandon him to his riches! From the
      success of my venture I reserved four thousand dollars to keep by me and
      for my expenses, and it is humiliating to relate that all of this, except
      a small banknote or two, was taken from me last night by amateurs. I
      should keep away from cards&mdash;they hate me, and alone I can do nothing
      with them. Some young gentlemen of the place, whose acquaintance I had
      made at a ball, did me the honour of this lesson at the native game of
      poker, at which I&mdash;though also native&mdash;am not even so expert as
      yourself, and, as you will admit, Antonio, my friend, you are not a good
      player&mdash;when observed. Unaided, I was a child in their hands. It was
      also a painful rule that one paid for the counters upon delivery. This
      made me ill, but I carried it off with an air of carelessness creditable
      to an adopted Neapolitan. Upon receipt of the money you are to cable me, I
      shall leave this town and sail immediately. Come to Paris, and meet me
      there at the place on the Rue Auber within ten days from your reading this
      letter. You will have, remaining, two hundred and twenty-five thousand
      francs, which it will be safer to bring in cash, and I will deal well with
      you, as is our custom with each other. You have done excellently
      throughout; your cables and letters for exhibition concerning those famous
      oil wells have been perfection; and I shall of course not deduct what was
      taken by these thieves of poker players from the sum of profits upon which
      we shall estimate your commission. I have several times had the feeling
      that the hour for departure had arrived; now I shall delay not a moment
      after receiving your cable, though I may occupy the interim with a last
      attempt to interest my small miser. Various circumstances cause me some
      uneasiness, though I do not believe I could be successfully assailed by
      the law in the matter of oil. You do own an estate in Basilicata, at least
      your brother does&mdash;these good people here would not be apt to
      discover the difference&mdash;and the rest is a matter of plausibility.
      The odious coincidence of encountering the old cow, Pryor, fretted me
      somewhat (though he has not repeated his annoying call), and I have other
      small apprehensions&mdash;for example, that it may not improve my credit
      if my loss of last night becomes gossip, though the thieves professed
      strong habits of discretion. My little affair of gallantry grows
      embarrassing. Such affairs are so easy to inaugurate; extrication is more
      difficult. However, without it I should have failed to interest my
      investor and there is always the charm. Your last letter is too curious in
      that matter. Licentious man, one does not write of these things while
      under the banner of the illustrious Uncle Sam&mdash;I am assuming the
      American attitude while here, or perhaps my early youth returns to me&mdash;a
      thing very different from your own boyhood, Don Antonio. Nevertheless, I
      promise you some laughter in the Rue Auber. Though you will not be able to
      understand the half of what I shall tell you&mdash;particularly the
      portraits I shall sketch of my defeated rivals&mdash;your spirit shall
      roll with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the bank, then, the instant you read. Cable me one thousand dollars,
      and be at the Rue Auber not more than ten days later. To the bank! Thence
      to the telegraph office. Speed! V. C.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in better spirits as he read over this letter, and he chuckled as
      he addressed it. He pictured himself in the rear room of the bar in the
      Rue Auber, relating, across the little marble-topped table, this American
      adventure, to the delight of that blithe, ne&rsquo;er-do-well outcast of
      an exalted poor family, that gambler, blackmailer and merry rogue, Don
      Antonio Moliterno, comrade and teacher of this ductile Valentine since the
      later days of adolescence. They had been school-fellows in Rome, and later
      roamed Europe together unleashed, discovering worlds of many kinds.
      Valentine&rsquo;s careless mother let her boy go as he liked, and was
      often negligent in the matter of remittances: he and his friend learned
      ways to raise the wind, becoming expert and making curious affiliations.
      At her death there was a small inheritance; she had not been provident.
      The little she left went rocketing, and there was the wind to be raised
      again: young Corliss had wits and had found that they could supply him&mdash;most
      of the time&mdash;with much more than the necessities of life. He had also
      found that he possessed a strong attraction for various women; already&mdash;at
      twenty-two&mdash;his experience was considerable, and, in his way, he
      became a specialist. He had a talent; he improved it and his
      opportunities. Altogether, he took to the work without malice and with a
      light heart. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      He sealed the envelope, rang for a boy, gave him the letter to post, and
      directed that the apartment should be set to rights. It was not that in
      which he had received Ray Vilas. Corliss had moved to rooms on another
      floor of the hotel, the day after that eccentric and somewhat ominous
      person had called to make an &ldquo;investment.&rdquo; Ray&rsquo;s shadowy
      forebodings concerning that former apartment had encountered satire:
      Corliss was a &ldquo;materialist&rdquo; and, at the mildest estimate, an
      unusually practical man, but he would never sleep in a bed with its foot
      toward the door; southern Italy had seeped into him. He changed his rooms,
      a measure of which Don Antonio Moliterno would have wholly approved.
      Besides, these were as comfortable as the others, and so like them as even
      to confirm Ray&rsquo;s statement concerning &ldquo;A Reading from Homer&rdquo;:
      evidently this work had been purchased by the edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boy came to announce that his &ldquo;roadster&rdquo; waited for him at
      the hotel entrance, and Corliss put on a fur motoring coat and cap, and
      went downstairs. A door leading from the hotel bar into the lobby was
      open, and, as Corliss passed it, there issued a mocking shout:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tor&rsquo;dor! Oh, look at the Tor&rsquo;dor! Ain&rsquo;t he the
      handsome Spaniard!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ray Vilas stumbled out, tousled, haggard, waving his arms in absurd and
      meaningless gestures; an amused gallery of tipplers filling the doorway
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; take Carmen buggy ride in the country, ain&rsquo;t he?
      Good ole Tor&rsquo;dor!&rdquo; he quavered loudly, clutching Corliss&rsquo;s
      shoulder. &ldquo;How much you s&rsquo;pose he pays f&rsquo; that
      buzz-buggy by the day, jeli&rsquo;m&rsquo;n? Naughty Tor&rsquo;dor, stole
      thousand dollars from me&mdash;makin&rsquo; presents&mdash;diamond
      cresses. Tor&rsquo;dor, I hear you been playing cards. Tha&rsquo;s sn&rsquo;t
      nice. Tor&rsquo;dor, you&rsquo;re not a goo&rsquo; boy at all&mdash;<i>you</i>
      know you oughtn&rsquo;t waste Dick Lindley&rsquo;s money like that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Corliss set his open hand upon the drunkard&rsquo;s breast and sent him
      gyrating and plunging backward. Some one caught the grotesque figure as it
      fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God,&rdquo; screamed Ray, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got a gun
      on me! He <i>knows</i> I haven&rsquo;t got my gun with me! <i>Why</i>
      haven&rsquo;t I got my gun with me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They hustled him away, and Corliss, enraged and startled, passed on. As he
      sped the car up Corliss Street, he decided to anticipate his letter to
      Moliterno by a cable. He had stayed too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora looked charming in a new equipment for November motoring; yet it
      cannot be said that either of them enjoyed the drive. They lunched a dozen
      miles out from the city at an establishment somewhat in the nature of a
      roadside inn; and, although its cuisine was quite unknown to Cora&rsquo;s
      friend, Mrs. Villard (an eager amateur of the table), they were served
      with a meal of such unusual excellence that the waiter thought it a
      thousand pities patrons so distinguished should possess such poor
      appetites.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned at about three in the afternoon, and Cora descended from the
      car wearing no very amiable expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you come in now?&rdquo; she asked, looking at him
      angrily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to talk things out. We&rsquo;ve settled
      nothing whatever. I want to know why you can&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some matters to attend to, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matters?&rdquo; She shot him a glance of fierce skepticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you packing to get out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora!&rdquo; he cried reproachfully, &ldquo;how can you say things
      like that to <i>me</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;Oh, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me in the least!
      How do <i>I</i> know what you&rsquo;ll do? For all I know, you may be just
      that kind of a man. You <i>said</i> you ought to be going&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora,&rdquo; he explained, gently, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I
      meant to go. I said only that I thought I ought to, because Moliterno will
      be needing me in Basilicata. I ought to be there, since it appears that no
      more money is to be raised here. I ought to be superintending operations
      in the oil-field, so as to make the best use of the little I have raised.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Of course <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t
      have anything to do with it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed deeply. &ldquo;You know perfectly well that I appreciate all you
      did. We don&rsquo;t seem to get on very well to-day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; She laughed again, bitterly. &ldquo;So you think you&rsquo;ll
      be going, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my rooms to write some necessary letters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not to pack your trunk?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora,&rdquo; he returned, goaded; &ldquo;sometimes you&rsquo;re
      just impossible. I&rsquo;ll come to-morrow forenoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t bring the car. I&rsquo;m tired of motoring and
      tired of lunching in that rotten hole. We can talk just as well in the
      library. Papa&rsquo;s better, and that little fiend will be in school
      to-morrow. Come out about ten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He started the machine. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget I love you,&rdquo; he
      called in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood looking after him as the car dwindled down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you do!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked up the path to the house, her face thoughtful, as with a
      tiresome perplexity. In her own room, divesting herself of her wraps, she
      gave the mirror a long scrutiny. It offered the picture of a girl with a
      hard and dreary air; but Cora saw something else, and presently, though
      the dreariness remained, the hardness softened to a great compassion. She
      suffered: a warm wave of sorrow submerged her, and she threw herself upon
      the bed and wept long and silently for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last her eyes dried, and she lay staring at the ceiling. The doorbell
      rang, and Sarah, the cook, came to inform her that Mr. Richard Lindley was
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;m out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Sarah. &ldquo;Done told him you was
      home.&rdquo; And she departed firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus abandoned, the prostrate lady put into a few words what she felt
      about Sarah, and, going to the door, whisperingly summoned in Laura, who
      was leaving the sick-room, across the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard is downstairs. Will you go and tell him I&rsquo;m sick in
      bed&mdash;or dead? Anything to make him go.&rdquo; And, assuming Laura&rsquo;s
      acquiescence, Cora went on, without pause: &ldquo;Is father worse? What&rsquo;s
      the matter with you, Laura?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. He&rsquo;s a little better, Miss Peirce thinks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look ill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then run along like a duck and get rid of that old bore for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora&mdash;please see him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me! I&rsquo;ve got too much to think about to bother with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura walked to the window and stood with her back to her sister,
      apparently interested in the view of Corliss Street there presented.
      &ldquo;Cora,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you marry him and
      have done with all this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora hooted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Why not marry him as soon as you can get ready? Why don&rsquo;t
      you go down now and tell him you will? Why not, Cora?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d as soon marry a pail of milk&mdash;yes, tepid milk,
      skimmed! I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you realize how kind he&rsquo;d be to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Cora moodily. &ldquo;He
      might object to some things&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t matter, because I&rsquo;m
      not going to try him. I don&rsquo;t mind a man&rsquo;s being a fool, but I
      can&rsquo;t stand the absent-minded breed of idiot. I&rsquo;ve worn his
      diamond in the pendant right in his eyes for weeks; he&rsquo;s never once
      noticed it enough even to ask me about the pendant, but bores me to death
      wanting to know why I won&rsquo;t wear the ring! Anyhow, what&rsquo;s the
      use talking about him? He couldn&rsquo;t marry me right now, even if I
      wanted him to&mdash;not till he begins to get something on the investment
      he made with Val. Outside of that, he&rsquo;s got nothing except his rooms
      at his mother&rsquo;s; she hasn&rsquo;t much either; and if Richard should
      lose what he put in with Val, he couldn&rsquo;t marry for years, probably.
      That&rsquo;s what made him so obstinate about it. No; if I ever marry
      right off the reel it&rsquo;s got to be somebody with&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora&rdquo;&mdash;Laura still spoke from the window, not turning&mdash;&ldquo;aren&rsquo;t
      you tired of it all, of this getting so upset about one man and then
      another and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tired</i>!&rdquo; Cora uttered the word in a repressed fury of
      emphasis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of <i>everything</i>! I don&rsquo;t care
      for anything or anybody on this earth&mdash;except&mdash;except you and
      mamma. I thought I was going to love Val. I thought I <i>did</i>&mdash;but
      oh, my Lord, I don&rsquo;t! I don&rsquo;t think I <i>can</i> care any
      more. Or else there isn&rsquo;t any such thing as love. How can anybody
      tell whether there is or not? You get kind of crazy over a man and want to
      go the limit&mdash;or marry him perhaps&mdash;or sometimes you just want
      to make him crazy about you&mdash;and then you get over it&mdash;and what
      is there left but hell!&rdquo; She choked with a sour laugh. &ldquo;Ugh!
      For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Laura, don&rsquo;t make me talk. Everything&rsquo;s
      gone to the devil and I&rsquo;ve got to think. The best thing you can do
      is to go down and get rid of Richard for me. I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> see him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Laura, and went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a darling,&rdquo; whispered Cora, kissing her quickly.
      &ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;m in a raging headache&mdash;make him think I
      wanted to see him, but you wouldn&rsquo;t let me, because I&rsquo;m too
      ill.&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;Give me a little time, old dear: I may
      decide to take him yet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Madison who informed the waiting Richard that Cora was unable
      to see him, because she was &ldquo;lying down&rdquo;; and the young man,
      after properly inquiring about Mr. Madison, went blankly forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick was stalking the front yard, mounted at a great height upon a pair
      of stilts. He joined the departing visitor upon the sidewalk and honoured
      him with his company, proceeding storkishly beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been to see Cora?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Hedrick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you want to see her about?&rdquo; asked the frank
      youth seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was able to smile. &ldquo;Nothing in particular, Hedrick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come to tell her about something?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever, my dear sir. I wished merely the honour of seeing
      her and chatting with her upon indifferent subjects.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sorry to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s home, all right,&rdquo; Hedrick took pleasure in
      informing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She was lying down and I told your mother not to disturb her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worn out with too much automobile riding, I expect,&rdquo; Hedrick
      sniffed. &ldquo;She goes out about every day with this Corliss in his
      hired roadster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on in silence. Not far from Mrs. Lindley&rsquo;s, Hedrick
      abruptly became vocal in an artificial laugh. Richard was obviously
      intended to inquire into its cause, but, as he did not, Hedrick, after
      laughing hollowly for some time, volunteered the explanation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I played a pretty good trick on you last night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Odd I didn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it was good. You&rsquo;d never guess it in the
      world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I believe I shouldn&rsquo;t. You see what makes it so hard,
      Hedrick, is that I can&rsquo;t even remember seeing you, last night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody saw me. Somebody heard me though, all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nigger that works at your mother&rsquo;s&mdash;Joe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about it? Were you teasing Joe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was you I was after.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? Did you get me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedrick made another somewhat ghastly pretence of mirth. &ldquo;Well, I
      guess I&rsquo;ve had about all the fun out of it I&rsquo;m going to. Might
      as well tell you. It was that book of Laura&rsquo;s you thought she sent
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard stopped short; whereupon Hedrick turned clumsily, and began to
      stalk back in the direction from which they had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That book&mdash;I thought she&mdash;sent me?&rdquo; Lindley
      repeated, stammering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never sent it,&rdquo; called the boy, continuing to walk away.
      &ldquo;She kept it hid, and I found it. I faked her into writing your name
      on a sheet of paper, and made you think she&rsquo;d sent the old thing to
      you. I just did it for a joke on you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With too retching an effort to simulate another burst of merriment, he
      caught the stump of his right stilt in a pavement crack, wavered, cut in
      the air a figure like a geometrical proposition gone mad, and came
      whacking to earth in magnificent disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard took him to Mrs. Lindley for repairs. She kept him until dark:
      Hedrick was bandaged, led, lemonaded and blandished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never in his life had he known such a listener.

      CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      That was a long night for Cora Madison, and the morning found her yellow.
      She made a poor breakfast, and returned from the table to her own room,
      but after a time descended restlessly and wandered from one room to
      another, staring out of the windows. Laura had gone out; Mrs. Madison was
      with her husband, whom she seldom left; Hedrick had departed ostensibly
      for school; and the house was as still as a farm in winter&mdash;an
      intolerable condition of things for an effervescent young woman whose diet
      was excitement. Cora, drumming with her fingers upon a window in the
      owl-haunted cell, made noises with her throat, her breath and her lips not
      unsuggestive of a sputtering fuse. She was heavily charged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what in thunder do <i>you</i> want?&rdquo; she inquired of an
      elderly man who turned in from the sidewalk and with serious steps
      approached the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pryor, having rung, found himself confronted with the lady he had come to
      seek. Ensued the moment of strangers meeting: invisible antennae extended
      and touched;&mdash;at the contact, Cora&rsquo;s drew in, and she looked
      upon him without graciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just called,&rdquo; he said placatively, smiling as if some
      humour lurked in his intention, &ldquo;to ask how your father is. I heard
      downtown he wasn&rsquo;t getting along quite so well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s better this morning, thanks,&rdquo; said Cora, preparing
      to close the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d just stop and ask about him. I heard he&rsquo;d
      had another bad spell&mdash;kind of a second stroke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was night before last. The doctor thinks he&rsquo;s improved
      very much since then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was closing; he coughed hastily, and detained it by speaking
      again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve called several times to inquire about him, but I
      believe it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of speaking
      to you, Miss Madison. I&rsquo;m Mr. Pryor.&rdquo; She appeared to find no
      comment necessary, and he continued: &ldquo;Your father did a little
      business for me, several years ago, and when I was here on my vacation,
      this summer, I was mighty sorry to hear of his sickness. I&rsquo;ve had a
      nice bit of luck lately and got a second furlough, so I came out to spend
      a couple of weeks and Thanksgiving with my married daughter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora supposed that it must be very pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;But I was mighty sorry to hear your
      father wasn&rsquo;t much better than when I left. The truth is, I wanted
      to have a talk with him, and I&rsquo;ve been reproaching myself a good
      deal that I didn&rsquo;t go ahead with it last summer, when he was well,
      only I thought then it mightn&rsquo;t be necessary&mdash;might be
      disturbing things without much reason.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t have a talk with him now,&rdquo;
      she said. &ldquo;The doctor says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; said Pryor, &ldquo;of course. I wonder&rdquo;&mdash;he
      hesitated, smiling faintly&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder if I could have it with
      you instead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t business,&rdquo; he laughed, observing her
      expression. &ldquo;That is, not exactly.&rdquo; His manner became very
      serious. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about a friend of mine&mdash;at least, a man I
      know pretty well. Miss Madison, I saw you driving out through the park
      with him, yesterday noon, in an automobile. Valentine Corliss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora stared at him. Honesty, friendliness, and grave concern were
      disclosed to her scrutiny. There was no mistaking him: he was a good man.
      Her mouth opened, and her eyelids flickered as from a too sudden invasion
      of light&mdash;the look of one perceiving the close approach of a vital
      crisis. But there was no surprise in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    *       *       *
</pre>
    <p>
      . . . . When Corliss arrived, at about eleven o&rsquo;clock that morning,
      Sarah brought him to the library, where he found Cora waiting for him. He
      had the air of a man determined to be cheerful under adverse conditions:
      he came in briskly, and Cora closed the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep away from me,&rdquo; she said, pushing him back sharply, the
      next instant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of that for a while I believe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank into a chair, affecting desolation. &ldquo;Caresses blighted in
      the bud! Cora, one would think us really married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked across the floor to a window, turned there, with her back to
      the light, and stood facing him, her arms folded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he exclaimed, noting this attitude. &ldquo;Is
      it the trial scene from a faded melodrama?&rdquo; She looked steadily at
      him without replying. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about to-day?&rdquo; he
      asked lightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to give you the proper cues if you&rsquo;ll
      indicate the general nature of the scene, Cora mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued to look at him in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very effective,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Brings out
      the figure, too. Do forgive me if you&rsquo;re serious, dear lady, but
      never in my life was I able to take the folded-arms business seriously. It
      was used on the stage of all countries so much that I believe most
      new-school actors have dropped it. They think it lacks genuineness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora waited a moment longer, then spoke. &ldquo;How much chance have I to
      get Richard Lindley&rsquo;s money back from you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was astounded. &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a caller, this morning,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;He
      talked about you&mdash;quite a lot! He&rsquo;s told me several things
      about you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vilas?&rdquo; he asked, with a sting in his quick smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered coolly. &ldquo;Much older.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that he jumped up, stepped quickly close to her, and swept her with an
      intense and brilliant scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pryor, by God!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows you pretty well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So do I now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung away from her, back to his chair, dropped into it and began to
      laugh. &ldquo;Old Pryor! Doddering old Pryor! Doddering old ass of a
      Pryor! So he did! Blood of an angel! what a stew, what a stew!&rdquo; He
      rose again, mirthless. &ldquo;Well, what did he say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had begun to tremble, not with fear. &ldquo;He said a good deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what was it? What did he tell you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll find it plenty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i>!&rdquo; She pointed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me&rdquo;&mdash;she burst out furiously&mdash;&ldquo;he
      said you were a professional sharper!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. Old Pryor doesn&rsquo;t talk like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She came toward him. &ldquo;He told me you were notorious over half of
      Europe,&rdquo; she cried vehemently. &ldquo;He said he&rsquo;d arrested
      you himself, once, in Rotterdam, for smuggling jewels, and that you were
      guilty, but managed to squirm out of it. He said the police had put you
      out of Germany and you&rsquo;d be arrested if you ever tried to go back.
      He said there were other places you didn&rsquo;t dare set foot in, and he
      said he could have you arrested in this country any time he wanted to, and
      that he was going to do it if he found you&rsquo;d been doing anything
      wrong. Oh, yes, he told me a few things!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her by the shoulder. &ldquo;See here, Cora, do you believe all
      this tommy-rot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook his hand off instantly. &ldquo;Believe it? I know it! There isn&rsquo;t
      a straight line in your whole soul and mind: you&rsquo;re crooked all
      over. You&rsquo;ve been crooked with <i>me</i> from the start. The moment
      that man began to speak, I knew every word of it was true. He came to me
      because he thought it was right: he hasn&rsquo;t anything against you on
      his own account; he said he <i>liked</i> you! I <i>knew</i> it was true, I
      tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to put his hand on her shoulder again, beginning to speak
      remonstratingly, but she cried out in a rage, broke away from him, and ran
      to the other end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep away! Do you suppose I like you to touch me? He told me you
      always had been a wonder with women! Said you were famous for `handling
      them the right way&rsquo;&mdash;using them! Ah, that was pleasant
      information for <i>me</i>, wasn&rsquo;t it! Yes, I could have confirmed
      him on that point. He wanted to know if I thought you&rsquo;d been doing
      anything of that sort here. What he meant was: Had you been using me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you tell him?&rdquo; The question rang sharply on the
      instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! That gets into you, does it?&rdquo; she returned bitterly.
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t overdo your fear of that man, I think, but <i>I</i>
      didn&rsquo;t tell him anything. I just listened and thanked him for the
      warning, and said I&rsquo;d have nothing more to do with you. How <i>could</i>
      I tell him? Wasn&rsquo;t it I that made papa lend you his name, and got
      Richard to hand over his money? Where does that put <i>me</i>?&rdquo; She
      choked; sobs broke her voice. &ldquo;Every&mdash;every soul in town would
      point me out as a laughing-stock&mdash;the easiest fool out of the asylum!
      Do you suppose <i>I</i> want you arrested and the whole thing in the
      papers? What I want is Richard&rsquo;s money back, and I&rsquo;m going to
      have it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you be quiet for a moment and listen?&rdquo; he asked gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll tell me what chance I have to get it back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want it back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? Don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He smiled faintly, and went on. &ldquo;Now, all this
      nonsense of old Pryor&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t worth denying. I have met him
      abroad; that much is true&mdash;and I suppose I have rather a gay
      reputation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She uttered a jeering shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d cut quite a
      swathe, when I first talked to you about myself. Let it go for the present
      and come down to this question of Lindley&rsquo;s investment&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s what I want you to come down to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as Lindley paid in his check I gave him his stock
      certificates, and cabled the money to be used at once in the development
      of the oil-fields&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! That man told me you&rsquo;d `promoted&rsquo; a South
      American rubber company once, among people of the American colony in
      Paris. The details he gave me sounded strangely familiar!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d as well be patient, Cora. Now, that money has probably
      been partially spent, by this time, on tools and labour and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you trying to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you. But first I&rsquo;d like you to understand
      that nothing can be done to me. There&rsquo;s nothing `on&rsquo; me! I&rsquo;ve
      acted in good faith, and if the venture in oil is unsuccessful, and the
      money lost, I can&rsquo;t be held legally responsible, nor can any one
      prove that I am. I could bring forty witnesses from Naples to swear they
      have helped to bore the wells. I&rsquo;m safe as your stubborn friend, Mr.
      Trumble, himself. But now then, suppose that old Pryor is right&mdash;as
      of course he isn&rsquo;t&mdash;suppose it, merely for a moment, because it
      will aid me to convey something to your mind. If I were the kind of man he
      says I am, and, being such a man, had planted the money out of reach, for
      my own use, what on earth would induce me to give it back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; she groaned. &ldquo;I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;it would be impossible. We
      must go on supposing for a moment: if I had put that money away, I might
      be contemplating a departure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better!&rdquo; she cried fiercely. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      going to find out everything you&rsquo;ve been doing. He said so. He&rsquo;s
      heard a rumour that you were trying to raise money here; he told me so,
      and said he&rsquo;d soon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better reason for not delaying, perhaps. Cora, see here!&rdquo;
      He moved nearer her. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I need a lot of money if I
      expected to have a beautiful lady to care for, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You idiot!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m going
      with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He flushed heavily. &ldquo;Well, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He paused, to
      stare at her, as she wrung her hands and sobbed with hysterical laughter.
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he went on, slowly, &ldquo;that you would
      possibly even insist on that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord!&rdquo; She stamped her foot, and with both
      hands threw the tears from her eyes in wide and furious gestures. &ldquo;He
      told me you were married&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you let him think you hadn&rsquo;t known that?&rdquo; demanded
      Corliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I didn&rsquo;t let him think <i>anything</i>! He said
      you would never be able to get a divorce: that your wife hates you too
      much to get one from you, and that she&rsquo;ll never&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Cora,&rdquo; he said harshly, &ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d
      been married; I told you before I ever kissed you. You understood
      perfectly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not! You said you <i>had</i> been. You laughed about it. You
      made me think it was something that had happened a long time ago. I
      thought of course you&rsquo;d been divorced&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I told you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me after! And then you made me think you could easily get
      one&mdash;that it was only a matter of form and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the most elaborate
      little self-deceiver I ever knew. I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve ever
      faced yourself for an honest moment in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest! <i>you</i> talk about `honest&rsquo;! You use that word and
      face <i>me</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He came closer, meeting her distraught eyes squarely. &ldquo;You love to
      fool yourself, Cora, but the role of betrayed virtue doesn&rsquo;t suit
      you very well. You&rsquo;re young, but you&rsquo;re a pretty experienced
      woman for all that, and you haven&rsquo;t done anything you didn&rsquo;t
      want to. You&rsquo;ve had both eyes open every minute, and we both know
      it. You are just as wise as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying and <i>you</i> know it! What did <i>I</i> want
      to make Richard go into your scheme for? You made a fool of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not speaking of the money now,&rdquo; he returned
      quickly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better keep your mind on the subject. Are you
      coming away with me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>for</i>?&rdquo; he echoed incredulously. &ldquo;I want to
      know if you&rsquo;re coming. I promise you I&rsquo;ll get a divorce as
      soon as it&rsquo;s possible&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Val,&rdquo; she said, in a tone lower than she had used since he
      entered the room; &ldquo;Val, do you want me to come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much?&rdquo; She looked at him eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo; His answer sounded quite genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it hurt you if I don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heaven for that,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You honestly mean you won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes me sick with laughing just to imagine it! I&rsquo;ve done
      some hard little thinking, lately, my friend&mdash;particularly last
      night, and still more particularly this morning since that man was here. I&rsquo;d
      cut my throat before I&rsquo;d go with you. If you had your divorce I
      wouldn&rsquo;t marry you&mdash;not if you were the last man on earth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora,&rdquo; he cried, aghast, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with
      you? You&rsquo;re too many for me sometimes. I thought I understood a few
      kinds of women! Now listen: I&rsquo;ve offered to take you, and you can&rsquo;t
      say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Offered!&rdquo; It was she who came toward him now. She came
      swiftly, shaking with rage, and struck him upon the breast. &ldquo;`Offered&rsquo;!
      Do you think I want to go trailing around Europe with you while Dick
      Lindley&rsquo;s money lasts? What kind of a life are you `offering&rsquo;
      me? Do you suppose I&rsquo;m going to have everybody saying Cora Madison
      ran away with a jail-bird? Do you think I&rsquo;m going to dodge decent
      people in hotels and steamers, and leave a name in this town that&mdash;Oh,
      get out! I don&rsquo;t want any help from you! I can take care of myself,
      I tell you; and I don&rsquo;t have to marry <i>you</i>! I&rsquo;d kill you
      if I could&mdash;you made a fool of me!&rdquo; Her voice rose shrilly.
      &ldquo;You made a fool of me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made a fool of me!&rdquo; She struck him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I love you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Actor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora, I want you. I want you more than I ever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She screamed with hysterical laughter. &ldquo;Liar, liar, liar! The same
      old guff. Don&rsquo;t you even see it&rsquo;s too late for the old rotten
      tricks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora, I want you to come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor, conceited fool,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;do you think you&rsquo;re
      the only man I can marry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, get out! Get out <i>now</i>! I&rsquo;m tired of you. I never
      want to hear you speak again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;For the last time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>No</i>! You made a fool of me!&rdquo; She beat him upon the
      breast, striking again and again, with all her strength. &ldquo;Get out, I
      tell you! I&rsquo;m through with you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to make her listen, to hold her wrists: he could do neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out&mdash;get out!&rdquo; she screamed. She pushed and dragged
      him toward the door, and threw it open. Her voice thickened; she choked
      and coughed, but kept on screaming: &ldquo;Get out, I tell you! Get out,
      get out, damn you! Damn you, <i>damn</i> you! get out!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still continuing to strike him with all her strength, she forced him out
      of the door.

      CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cora lost no time. Corliss had not closed the front door behind him before
      she was running up the stairs. Mrs. Madison, emerging from her husband&rsquo;s
      room, did not see her daughter&rsquo;s face; for Cora passed her quickly,
      looking the other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was anything the matter?&rdquo; asked the mother anxiously. &ldquo;I
      thought I heard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in the world,&rdquo; Cora flung back over her shoulder.
      &ldquo;Mr. Corliss said I couldn&rsquo;t imitate Sara Bernhardt, and I
      showed him I could.&rdquo; She began to hum; left a fragment of &ldquo;rag-time&rdquo;
      floating behind her as she entered her own room; and Mrs. Madison,
      relieved, returned to the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora changed her clothes quickly. She put on a pale gray skirt and coat
      for the street, high shoes and a black velvet hat, very simple. The
      costume was almost startlingly becoming to her: never in her life had she
      looked prettier. She opened her small jewel-case, slipped all her rings
      upon her fingers; then put the diamond crescent, the pendant, her watch,
      and three or four other things into the flat, envelope-shaped bag of soft
      leather she carried when shopping. After that she brought from her
      clothes-pantry a small travelling-bag and packed it hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura, returning from errands downtown and glancing up at Cora&rsquo;s
      window, perceived an urgently beckoning, gray-gloved hand, and came at
      once to her sister&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The packed bag upon the bed first caught her eye; then Cora&rsquo;s
      attire, and the excited expression of Cora&rsquo;s face, which was
      high-flushed and moist, glowing with a great resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; asked Laura quickly. &ldquo;You look
      exactly like a going-away bride. What&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora spoke rapidly: &ldquo;Laura, I want you to take this bag and keep it
      in your room till a messenger-boy comes for it. When the bell rings, go to
      the door yourself, and hand it to him. Don&rsquo;t give Hedrick a chance
      to go to the door. Just give it to the boy;&mdash;and don&rsquo;t say
      anything to mamma about it. I&rsquo;m going downtown and I may not be
      back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura began to be frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want to do, Cora?&rdquo; she asked, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora was swift and business-like. &ldquo;See here, Laura, I&rsquo;ve got
      to keep my head about me. You can do a great deal for me, if you won&rsquo;t
      be emotional just now, and help me not to be. I can&rsquo;t afford it,
      because I&rsquo;ve got to do things, and I&rsquo;m going to do them just
      as quickly as I can, and get it over. If I wait any longer I&rsquo;ll go
      insane. I <i>can</i>&rsquo;T wait! You&rsquo;ve been a wonderful sister to
      me; I&rsquo;ve always counted on you, and you&rsquo;ve never once gone
      back on me. Right now, I need you to help me more than I ever have in my
      life. Will you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you needn&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;ll tell you just this much: I&rsquo;ve
      got myself in a devil of a mess&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura threw her arms round her: &ldquo;Oh, my dear, dear little sister!&rdquo;
      she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cora drew away. &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s just what you mustn&rsquo;t
      do. I can&rsquo;t stand it! You&rsquo;ve got to be <i>quiet</i>. I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Laura said hurriedly. &ldquo;I will. I&rsquo;ll do
      whatever you say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly simple: all I want you to do is to take charge
      of my travelling-bag, and, when a messenger-boy comes, give it to him
      without letting anybody know anything about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got to know where you&rsquo;re going&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
      let you go and not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can! Besides, you&rsquo;ve promised to. I&rsquo;m not
      going to do anything foolish &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why not tell me?&rdquo; Laura began. She went on, imploring
      Cora to confide in her, entreating her to see their mother&mdash;to do a
      dozen things altogether outside of Cora&rsquo;s plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wasting your breath, Laura,&rdquo; said the younger
      sister, interrupting, &ldquo;and wasting my time. You&rsquo;re in the
      dark: you think I&rsquo;m going to run away with Val Corliss and you&rsquo;re
      wrong. I sent him out of the house for good, a while ago&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heaven for that!&rdquo; cried Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take care of myself,&rdquo; Cora went on
      rapidly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get out of the mess I&rsquo;m in, and
      you&rsquo;ve got to let me do it my own way. I&rsquo;ll send you a note
      from downtown. You see that the messenger&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was at the door, but Laura caught her by the sleeve, protesting and
      beseeching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora turned desperately. &ldquo;See here. I&rsquo;ll come back in two
      hours and tell you all about it. If I promise that, will you promise to
      send me the bag by the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re coming back you won&rsquo;t need&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora spoke very quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to pieces in a moment.
      Really, I do think I&rsquo;d better jump out of the window and have it
      over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send the bag,&rdquo; Laura quavered, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll
      promise to come back in two hours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora gave her a quick embrace, a quick kiss, and, dry-eyed, ran out of the
      room, down the stairs, and out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked briskly down Corliss Street. It was a clear day, bright noon,
      with an exhilarating tang in the air, and a sky so glorious that people
      outdoors were continually conscious of the blue overhead, and looked up at
      it often. An autumnal cheerfulness was abroad, and pedestrians showed it
      in their quickened steps, in their enlivened eyes, and frequent smiles,
      and in the colour of their faces. But none showed more colour or a gayer
      look than Cora. She encountered many whom she knew, for it was indeed a
      day to be stirring, and she nodded and smiled her way all down the long
      street, thinking of what these greeted people would say to-morrow. &ldquo;<i>I</i>
      saw her yesterday, walking down Corliss Street, about noon, in a gray suit
      and looking fairly radiant!&rdquo; Some of those she met were enemies she
      had chastened; she prophesied their remarks with accuracy. Some were old
      suitors, men who had desired her; one or two had place upon her long list
      of boy-sweethearts: she gave the same gay, friendly nod to each of them,
      and foretold his morrow&rsquo;s thoughts of her, in turn. Her greeting of
      Mary Kane was graver, as was aesthetically appropriate, Mr. Wattling&rsquo;s
      engagement having been broken by that lady, immediately after his drive to
      the Country Club for tea. Cora received from the beautiful jilt a
      salutation even graver than her own, which did not confound her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halfway down the street was a drug-store. She went in, and obtained
      appreciative permission to use the telephone. She came out well satisfied,
      and went swiftly on her way. Ten minutes later, she opened the door of
      Wade Trumble&rsquo;s office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was alone; her telephone had caught him in the act of departing for
      lunch. But he had been glad to wait&mdash;glad to the verge of agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, Cora!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as she came quickly in and
      closed the door, &ldquo;but you <i>can</i> look stunning! Believe me, that&rsquo;s
      some get-up. But let me tell you right here and now, before you begin, it&rsquo;s
      no use your tackling me again on the oil proposition. If there was any
      chance of my going into it which there wasn&rsquo;t, not one on earth&mdash;why,
      the very fact of your asking me would have stopped me. I&rsquo;m no Dick
      Lindley, I beg to inform you: I don&rsquo;t spend my money helping a girl
      that I want, myself, to make a hit with another man. You treated me like a
      dog about that, right in the street, and you needn&rsquo;t try it again,
      because I won&rsquo;t stand for it. You can&rsquo;t play <i>me</i>, Cora!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wade,&rdquo; she said, coming closer, and looking at him
      mysteriously, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you tell me to come to you when I got
      through playing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; He grew very red, took a step back from her, staring
      at her distrustfully, incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got through playing&rdquo;, she said in a low voice.
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve come to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was staggered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he said,
      huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am, Wade.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had flushed, but now the colour left his small face, and he grew very
      white. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you mean it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was rotten to you about that oil
      nonsense. It <i>was</i> nonsense, nothing on earth but nonsense. I tell
      you frankly I was a fool. I didn&rsquo;t care the snap of my finger for
      Corliss, but&mdash;oh, what&rsquo;s the use of pretending? You were always
      such a great `business man,&rsquo; always so absorbed in business, and put
      it before everything else in the world. You cared for me, but you cared
      for business more than for me. Well, no woman likes <i>that</i>, Wade. I&rsquo;ve
      come to tell you the whole thing: I can&rsquo;t stand it any longer. I
      suffered horribly because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She faltered.
      &ldquo;Wade, that was no way to <i>win</i> a girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora!&rdquo; His incredulity was strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I hated you for it, Wade. Yes, I did think that; I&rsquo;m
      telling you everything, you see just blurting it out as it comes, Wade.
      Well, Corliss asked me to help him, and it struck me I&rsquo;d show that I
      could understand a business deal, myself. Wade, this is pretty hard to
      say, I was such a little fool, but you ought to know it. You&rsquo;ve got
      a right to know it, Wade: I thought if I put through a thing like that, it
      would make a tremendous hit with you, and that then I could say: `So this
      is the kind of thing you put ahead of <i>me</i>, is it? Simple little
      things like this, that <i>I</i> can do, myself, by turning over my little
      finger!&rsquo; So I got Richard to go in&mdash;that was easy; and then it
      struck me that the crowning triumph of the whole thing would be to get you
      to come in yourself. That <i>would</i> be showing you, I thought! But you
      wouldn&rsquo;t: you put me in my place&mdash;and I was angry&mdash;I never
      was so angry in my life, and I showed it.&rdquo; Tears came into her
      voice. &ldquo;Oh, Wade,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;it was the very
      wildness of my anger that showed what I really felt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About&mdash;about <i>me</i>?&rdquo; His incredulity struggled with
      his hope. He stepped close to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an awful fool I&rsquo;ve been,&rdquo; she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought I could show you I was your <i>equal</i>! And look
      what it&rsquo;s got me into, Wade!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has it got you into, Cora?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing worth while: I can see what I really am when I try to
      meet you on your own ground.&rdquo; She bent her head, humbly, then lifted
      it, and spoke rapidly. &ldquo;All the rest is dreadful, Wade. I had a
      distrust of Corliss from the first; I didn&rsquo;t like him, but I took
      him up because I thought he offered the chance to show <i>you</i> what I
      could do. Well, it&rsquo;s got me into a most horrible mess. He&rsquo;s a
      swindler, a rank&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; Wade shouted. &ldquo;Cora, you&rsquo;re talking
      out now like a real woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen. I got horribly tired of him after a week or so, but I&rsquo;d
      promised to help him and I didn&rsquo;t break with him; but yesterday I
      just couldn&rsquo;t stand him any longer and I told him so, and sent him
      away. Then, this morning, an old man came to the house, a man named Pryor,
      who knew him and knew his record, and he told me all about him.&rdquo; She
      narrated the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had sent Corliss away first?&rdquo; Wade asked, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday, I tell you.&rdquo; She set her hand on the little man&rsquo;s
      shoulder. &ldquo;Wade, there&rsquo;s bound to be a scandal over all this.
      Even if Corliss gets away without being arrested and tried, the whole
      thing&rsquo;s bound to come <i>out</i>. I&rsquo;ll be the laughing-stock
      of the town&mdash;and I deserve to be: it&rsquo;s all through having been
      ridiculous idiot enough to try and impress you with my business
      brilliancy. Well, I can&rsquo;t stand it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora, do you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned toward him, her hand still on his shoulder, her exquisite voice
      lowered, and thrilling in its sweetness. &ldquo;Wade, I&rsquo;m through
      playing. I&rsquo;ve come to you at last because you&rsquo;ve utterly
      conquered me. If you&rsquo;ll take me away to-day, I&rsquo;ll <i>marry</i>
      you to-day!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a shout that rang again from the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me?&rdquo; she whispered; then smiled upon his rapture
      indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rapture it was. With the word &ldquo;marry,&rdquo; his incredulity sped
      forever. But for a time he was incoherent: he leaped and hopped, spoke
      broken bits of words, danced fragmentarily, ate her with his eyes,
      partially embraced her, and finally kissed her timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a wedding we&rsquo;ll have!&rdquo; he shouted, after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be married by a
      Justice of the Peace and not a soul there but us, and it will be now, or
      it never will be! If you don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He swore she should have her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll be out of this town on the three o&rsquo;clock
      train this afternoon,&rdquo; she said. She went on with her plans, while
      he, growing more accustomed to his privilege, caressed her as he would.
      &ldquo;You shall have your way,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in everything
      except the wedding-journey. That&rsquo;s got to be a long one&mdash;I won&rsquo;t
      come back here till people have forgotten all about this Corliss mix-up. I&rsquo;ve
      never been abroad, and I want you to take me. We can stay a long, long
      time. I&rsquo;ve brought nothing&mdash;we&rsquo;ll get whatever we want in
      New York before we sail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He agreed to everything. He had never really hoped to win her; paradise
      had opened, dazing him with glory: he was astounded, mad with joy, and
      abjectly his lady&rsquo;s servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better run along and get the license?&rdquo; she
      laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be married on the way to the train.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Cora!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;You angel!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait here for you,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t
      be too much time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He obtained a moderate control of his voice and feet. &ldquo;Enfield&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      my cashier&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be back from his lunch at one-thirty. Tell
      him about us, if I&rsquo;m not here by then. Tell him he&rsquo;s got to
      manage somehow. Good-bye till I come back Mrs. Trumble!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door he turned. &ldquo;Oh, have you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      He paused uncertainly. &ldquo;Have you sent Richard Lindley any word about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wade!&rdquo; She gave his inquiry an indulgent amusement. &ldquo;If
      I&rsquo;m not worrying about him, do you think you need to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You funny thing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I never had any idea of
      really marrying him; it wasn&rsquo;t anything but one of those silly
      half-engagements, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; he said, apologetically. &ldquo;I
      meant about letting him know what this Pryor told you about Corliss, so
      that Richard might do something toward getting his money back. We ought to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all
      right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw Richard?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I sent him a note. He knows all about it by this time, if he
      has been home this morning. You&rsquo;d better start, Wade. Send a
      messenger to our house for my bag. Tell him to bring it here and then take
      a note for me. You&rsquo;d really better start&mdash;dear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Cora</i>!&rdquo; he shouted, took her in his arms, and was gone.
      His departing gait down the corridor to the elevator seemed, from the
      sounds, to be a gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Cora wrote, sealed, and directed a note to Laura. In it she
      recounted what Pryor had told her of Corliss; begged Laura and her parents
      not to think her heartless in not preparing them for this abrupt marriage.
      She was in such a state of nervousness, she wrote, that explanations would
      have caused a breakdown. The marriage was a sensible one; she had long
      contemplated it as a possibility; and, after thinking it over thoroughly,
      she had decided it was the only thing to do. She sent her undying love.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting with this note in her hand when shuffling footsteps
      sounded in the corridor; either Wade&rsquo;s cashier or the messenger, she
      supposed. The door-knob turned, a husky voice asking, &ldquo;Want a drink?&rdquo;
      as the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora was not surprised&mdash;she knew Vilas&rsquo;s office was across the
      hall from that in which she waited&mdash;but she was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ray stood blinking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked, at last.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is probable that he got the truth out of her, perhaps all of it. That
      will remain a matter of doubt; Cora&rsquo;s evidence, if she gave it, not
      being wholly trustworthy in cases touching herself. But she felt no need
      of mentioning to any one that she had seen her former lover that day. He
      had gone before the return of Enfield, Mr. Trumble&rsquo;s assistant, who
      was a little later than usual, it happened; and the extreme nervousness
      and preoccupation exhibited by Cora in telling Enfield of his employer&rsquo;s
      new plans were attributed by the cashier to the natural agitation of a
      lady about to wed in a somewhat unusual (though sensible) manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the more probable that she told Ray the whole truth, because he
      already knew something of Corliss&rsquo;s record abroad. On the dusty desk
      in Ray&rsquo;s own office lay a letter, received that morning from the
      American Consul at Naples, which was luminous upon that subject, and upon
      the probabilities of financial returns for the investment of a thousand
      dollars in the alleged oil-fields of Basilicata.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, Cora had always found it very difficult to deceive Vilas: he
      had an almost perfect understanding of a part of her nature; she could
      never far mislead him about herself. With her, he was intuitive and jumped
      to strange, inconsistent, true conclusions, as women do. He had the art of
      reading her face, her gestures; he had learned to listen to the tone of
      her voice more than to what she said. In his cups, too, he had fitful but
      almost demoniac inspirations for hidden truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, remembering that Cora always &ldquo;got even,&rdquo; it remains
      finally to wonder if she might not have told him everything at the
      instance of some shadowy impulse in that direction. There may have been a
      luxury in whatever confession she made; perhaps it was not entirely forced
      from her, and heaven knows how she may have coloured it. There was an
      elusive, quiet satisfaction somewhere in her subsequent expression; it
      lurked deep under the surface of the excitement with which she talked to
      Enfield of her imminent marital abduction of his small boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her agitation, a relic of the unknown interview just past, simmered down
      soon, leaving her in a becoming glow of colour, with slender threads of
      moisture brilliantly outlining her eyelids. Mr. Enfield, a young,
      well-favoured and recent importation from another town, was deliciously
      impressed by the charm of the waiting lady. They had not met; and Enfield
      wondered how Trumble had compassed such an enormous success as this; and
      he wished that he had seen her before matters had gone so far. He thought
      he might have had a chance. She seemed pleasantly interested in him, even
      as it was&mdash;and her eyes were wonderful, with their swift, warm,
      direct little plunges into those of a chance comrade of the moment. She
      went to the window, in her restlessness, looking down upon the swarming
      street below, and the young man, standing beside her, felt her shoulder
      most pleasantly though very lightly&mdash;in contact with his own, as they
      leaned forward, the better to see some curiosity of advertising that
      passed. She turned her face to his just then, and told him that he must
      come to see her: the wedding journey would be long, she said, but it would
      not be forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trumble bounded in, shouting that everything was attended to, except
      instructions to Enfield, whom he pounded wildly upon the back. He began
      signing papers; a stenographer was called from another room of his
      offices; and there was half an hour of rapid-fire. Cora&rsquo;s bag came,
      and she gave the bearer the note for Laura; another bag was brought for
      Wade; and both bags were carried down to the automobile the bridegroom had
      left waiting in the street. Last, came a splendid cluster of orchids for
      the bride to wear, and then Wade, with his arm about her, swept her into
      the corridor, and the stirred Enfield was left to his own beating heart,
      and the fresh, radiant vision of this startling new acquaintance: the
      sweet mystery of the look she had thrown back at him over his employer&rsquo;s
      shoulder at the very last. &ldquo;Do not forget <i>me</i>!&rdquo; it had
      seemed to say. &ldquo;We shall come back&mdash;some day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The closed car bore the pair to the little grim marriage-shop quickly
      enough, though they were nearly run down by a furious police patrol
      automobile, at a corner near the Richfield Hotel. Their escape was by a
      very narrow margin of safety, and Cora closed her eyes. Then she was
      cross, because she had been frightened, and commanded Wade cavalierly to
      bid the driver be more careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wade obeyed sympathetically. &ldquo;Of course, though, it wasn&rsquo;t
      altogether his fault,&rdquo; he said, settling back, his arm round his
      lady&rsquo;s waist. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an outrage for the police to break
      their own rules that way. I guess they don&rsquo;t need to be in a hurry
      any more than <i>we</i> do!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Justice made short work of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they stood so briefly before him, there swept across her vision the
      memory of what she had always prophesied as her wedding:&mdash;a crowded
      church, &ldquo;The Light That Breathed O&rsquo;er Eden&rdquo; from an
      unseen singer; then the warm air trembling to the Lohengrin march; all
      heads turning; the procession down the aisle; herself appearing&mdash;climax
      of everything&mdash;a delicious and brilliant figure: graceful, rosy, shy,
      an imperial prize for the groom, who in these foreshadowings had always
      been very indistinct. The picture had always failed in outline there: the
      bridegroom&rsquo;s nearest approach to definition had never been clearer
      than a composite photograph. The truth is, Cora never in her life wished
      to be married.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Valentine Corliss had nothing to do but to wait for the money his friend
      Antonio would send him by cable. His own cable, anticipating his letter,
      had been sent yesterday, when he came back to the hotel, after lunching in
      the country with Cora.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked down Corliss Street, after his tumultuous interview with her,
      he was surprised to find himself physically tremulous: he had not supposed
      that an encounter, however violent, with an angry woman could so upset his
      nerves. It was no fear of Pryor which shook him. He knew that Pryor did
      not mean to cause his arrest&mdash;certainly not immediately. Of course,
      Pryor knew that Cora would tell him. The old fellow&rsquo;s move was a
      final notification. It meant: &ldquo;Get out of town within twenty-four
      hours.&rdquo; And Corliss intended to obey. He would have left that
      evening, indeed, without the warning; his trunk was packed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would miss Cora. He had kept a cool head throughout their affair until
      the last; but this morning she had fascinated him: and he found himself
      passionately admiring the fury of her. She had confused him as he had
      never been confused. He thought he had tamed her; thought he owned her;
      and the discovery of this mistake was what made him regret that she would
      not come away with him. Such a flight, until to-day, had been one of his
      apprehensions: but now the thought that it was not to be, brought
      something like pain. At least, he felt a vacancy; had a sense of something
      lacking. She would have been a bright comrade for the voyage; and he
      thought of gestures of hers, turns of the head, tricks of the lovely
      voice; and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it was best for him that he could return to his old trails alone
      and free; he saw that. Cora would have been a complication and an
      embarrassment without predictable end, but she would have been a rare
      flame for a while. He wondered what she meant to do; of course she had a
      plan. Should he try again, give her another chance? No; there was one
      point upon which she had not mystified him: he knew she really hated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . The wind was against the smoke that day; and his spirits rose, as he
      walked in the brisk air with the rich sky above him. After all, this
      venture upon his native purlieus had been fax from fruitless: he could not
      have expected to do much better. He had made his coup; he knew no other
      who could have done it. It was a handsome bit of work, in fact, and
      possible only to a talented native thoroughly sophisticated in certain
      foreign subtleties. He knew himself for a rare combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a glimmer of Richard Lindley beginning at the beginning again to
      build a modest fortune: it was the sort of thing the Richard Lindleys were
      made for. Corliss was not troubled. Richard had disliked him as a boy; did
      not like him now; but Corliss had not taken his money out of malice for
      that. The adventurer was not revengeful; he was merely impervious.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hotel, he learned that Moliterno&rsquo;s cable had not yet arrived;
      but he went to an agency of one of the steamship lines and reserved his
      passage, and to a railway ticket office and secured a compartment for
      himself on an evening train. Then he returned to his room in the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mirror over the mantelpiece, in the front room of his suite, showed
      him a fine figure of a man: hale, deep-chested, handsome, straight and
      cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old top,&rdquo; he said, reviewing and summing up his whole
      campaign, &ldquo;not so bad. Not so bad, all in all; not so bad, old top.
      Well played indeed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sound of footsteps approaching his door, he turned in casual
      expectancy, thinking it might be a boy to notify him that Moliterno&rsquo;s
      cable had arrived. But there was no knock, and the door was flung wide
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Vilas, and he had his gun with him this time. He had two.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a shallow clothes-closet in the wall near the fireplace, and
      Corliss ran in there; but Vilas began to shoot through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutilated, already a dead man, and knowing it, Corliss came out, and tried
      to run into the bedroom. It was no use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ray saved his last shot for himself. It did the work.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is a song of parting, an intentionally pathetic song, which contains
      the line, &ldquo;All the tomorrows shall be as to-day,&rdquo; meaning
      equally gloomy. Young singers, loving this line, take care to pronounce
      the words with unusual distinctness: the listener may feel that the
      performer has the capacity for great and consistent suffering. It is not,
      of course, that youth loves unhappiness, but the appearance of it, its
      supposed picturesqueness. Youth runs from what is pathetic, but hangs
      fondly upon pathos. It is the idea of sorrow, not sorrow, which charms:
      and so the young singer dwells upon those lingering tomorrows, happy in
      the conception of a permanent wretchedness incurred in the interest of
      sentiment. For youth believes in permanence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is when we are young that we say, &ldquo;I shall never,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;I shall always,&rdquo; not knowing that we are only time&rsquo;s
      atoms in a crucible of incredible change. An old man scarce dares say,
      &ldquo;I have never,&rdquo; for he knows that if he searches he will find,
      probably, that he has. &ldquo;All, all is change.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an evening during the winter holidays when Mrs. Lindley, coming to
      sit by the fire in her son&rsquo;s smoking-room, where Richard sat
      glooming, narrated her legend of the Devil of Lisieux. It must have been
      her legend: the people of Lisieux know nothing of it; but this Richard the
      Guileless took it for tradition, as she alleged it, and had no suspicion
      that she had spent the afternoon inventing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not begin the recital immediately upon taking her chair, across
      the hearth from her son; she led up to it. She was an ample,
      fresh-coloured, lively woman; and like her son only in being a kind soul:
      he got neither his mortal seriousness nor his dreaminess from her. She was
      more than content with Cora&rsquo;s abandonment of him, though, as
      chivalrousness was not demanded of her, she would have preferred that he
      should have been the jilt. She thought Richard well off in his release,
      even at the price of all his savings. But there was something to hope,
      even in that matter, Pryor wrote from Paris encouragingly: he believed
      that Moliterno might be frightened or forced into at least a partial
      restitution; though Richard would not count upon it, and had &ldquo;begun
      at the beginning&rdquo; again, as a small-salaried clerk in a bank,
      trudging patiently to work in the morning and home in the evening, a
      long-faced, tired young man, more absent than ever, lifeless, and with no
      interest in anything outside his own broodings. His mother, pleased with
      his misfortune in love, was of course troubled that it should cause him to
      suffer. She knew she could not heal him; but she also knew that everything
      is healed in time, and that sometimes it is possible for people to help
      time a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first remark to her son, this evening, was that to the best of her
      memory she had never used the word &ldquo;hellion.&rdquo; And, upon his
      saying gently, no, he thought it probable that she never had, but seeking
      no farther and dropping his eyes to the burning wood, apparently under the
      impression that the subject was closed, she informed him brusquely that it
      was her intention to say it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want to say, mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can bring myself to use the word `hellion&rsquo;,&rdquo; she
      returned, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to say that of all the heaven-born,
      whole-souled and consistent ones I ever knew Hedrick Madison is the King.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what new way?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egerton Villard. Egerton used to be the neatest, best-mannered,
      best-dressed boy in town; but he looks and behaves like a Digger Indian
      since he&rsquo;s taken to following Hedrick around. Mrs. Villard says it&rsquo;s
      the greatest sorrow of her life, but she&rsquo;s quite powerless: the boy
      is Hedrick&rsquo;s slave. The other day she sent a servant after him, and
      just bringing him home nearly ruined her limousine. He was solidly covered
      with molasses, over his clothes and all, from head to foot, and then he&rsquo;d
      rolled in hay and chicken feathers to be a <i>gnu</i> for Hedrick to kodak
      in the African Wilds of the Madisons&rsquo; stable. Egerton didn&rsquo;t
      know what a gnu was, but Hedrick told him that was the way to be one, he
      said. Then, when they&rsquo;d got him scraped and boiled, and most of his
      hair pulled out, a policemen came to arrest him for stealing the jug of
      molasses at a corner grocery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard nodded, and smiled faintly for comment. They sat in silence for a
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Mrs. Madison yesterday,&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;She
      seemed very cheerful; her husband is able to talk almost perfectly again,
      though he doesn&rsquo;t get downstairs. Laura reads to him a great deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded again, his gaze not moving from the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura was with her mother,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lindley. &ldquo;She
      looked very fetching in a black cloth suit and a fur hat&mdash;old ones
      her sister left, I suspect, but very becoming, for all that. Laura&rsquo;s
      `going out&rsquo; more than usual this winter. She&rsquo;s really the
      belle of the holiday dances, I hear. Of course she would be&rdquo;, she
      added, thoughtfully&mdash;&ldquo;now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should she be `now&rsquo; more than before?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Laura&rsquo;s quite blossomed,&rdquo; Mrs. Lindley answered.
      &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s had some great anxieties relieved. Of course
      both she and her mother must have worried about Cora as much as they
      waited on her. It must be a great burden lifted to have her comfortably
      settled, or, at least, disposed of. I thought they both looked better. But
      I have a special theory about Laura: I suppose you&rsquo;ll laugh at me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would sometimes,&rdquo; she said wistfully, &ldquo;so
      only you laughed. My idea is that Laura was in love with that poor little
      Trumble, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; He looked up at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; girls fall in love with anybody. I fancy she cared very deeply
      for him; but I think she&rsquo;s a strong, sane woman, now. She&rsquo;s
      about the steadiest, coolest person I know&mdash;and I know her better,
      lately, than I used to. I think she made up her mind that she&rsquo;d not
      sit down and mope over her unhappiness, and that she&rsquo;d get over what
      caused it; and she took the very best remedy: she began going about, going
      everywhere, and she went gayly, too! And I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s cured;
      I&rsquo;m sure she doesn&rsquo;t care the snap of her fingers for Wade
      Trumble or any man alive. She&rsquo;s having a pretty good time, I
      imagine: she has everything in the world except money, and she&rsquo;s
      never cared at all about <i>that</i>. She&rsquo;s young, and she dresses
      well&mdash;these days&mdash;and she&rsquo;s one of the handsomest girls in
      town; she plays like a poet, and she dances well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Richard;&mdash;reflectively, &ldquo;she does dance
      well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from what I hear from Mrs. Villard,&rdquo; continued his
      mother, &ldquo;I guess she has enough young men in love with her to keep
      any girl busy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was interested enough to show some surprise. &ldquo;In love with Laura?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four, I hear.&rdquo; The best of women are sometimes the readiest
      with impromptu statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; he said, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Laura has taken to smiling on the world, and the world
      smiles back at her. It&rsquo;s not a bad world about that, Richard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;I suppose not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s more than that in this case, my dear son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The intelligent and gentle matron laughed as though at some unexpected
      turn of memory and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of Hedrick, did you ever hear the story of the Devil of
      Lisieux, Richard?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not; at least, I don&rsquo;t remember it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisieux is a little town in Normandy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was
      there a few days with your father, one summer, long ago. It&rsquo;s a
      country full of old stories, folklore, and traditions; and the people
      still believe in the Old Scratch pretty literally. This legend was of the
      time when he came to Lisieux. The people knew he was coming because a wise
      woman had said that he was on the way, and predicted that he would arrive
      at the time of the great fair. Everybody was in great distress, because
      they knew that whoever looked at him would become bewitched, but, of
      course, they had to go to the fair. The wise woman was able to give them a
      little comfort; she said some one was coming with the devil, and that the
      people must not notice the devil, but keep their eyes fastened on this
      other&mdash;then they would be free of the fiend&rsquo;s influence. But,
      when the devil arrived at the fair, nobody even looked to see who his
      companion was, for the devil was so picturesque, so vivid, all in flaming
      scarlet and orange, and he capered and danced and sang so that nobody
      could help looking at him&mdash;and, after looking once, they couldn&rsquo;t
      look away until they were thoroughly under his spell. So they were all
      bewitched, and began to scream and howl and roll on the ground, and turn
      on each other and brawl, and `commit all manner of excesses.&rsquo; Then
      the wise woman was able to exorcise the devil, and he sank into the
      ground; but his companion stayed, and the people came to their senses, and
      looked, and they saw that it was an angel. The angel had been there all
      the time that the fiend was, of course. So they have a saying now, that
      there may be angels with us, but we don&rsquo;t notice them when the devil&rsquo;s
      about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not look at her son as she finished, and she had hurried through
      the latter part of her &ldquo;legend&rdquo; with increasing timidity. The
      parallel was more severe, now that she put it to him, than she intended;
      it sounded savage; and she feared she had overshot her mark. Laura, of
      course, was the other, the companion; she had been actually a companion
      for the vivid sister, everywhere with her at the fair, and never
      considered: now she emerged from her overshadowed obscurity, and people
      were able to see her as an individual&mdash;heretofore she had been merely
      the retinue of a flaming Cora. But the &ldquo;legend&rdquo; was not very
      gallant to Cora!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lindley knew that it hurt her son; she felt it without looking at
      him, and before he gave a sign. As it was, he did not speak, but, after a
      few moments, rose and went quietly out of the room: then she heard the
      front door open and close. She sat by his fire a long, long time and was
      sorry&mdash;and wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Richard came home from his cold night-prowl in the snowy streets, he
      found a sheet of note paper upon his pillow:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Richard, I didn&rsquo;t mean that anybody you ever cared
      for was a d&mdash;-l. I only meant that often the world finds out that
      there are lovely people it hasn&rsquo;t noticed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . He reproached himself, then, for the reproach his leaving her had
      been; he had a susceptible and annoying conscience, this unfortunate
      Richard. He found it hard to get to sleep, that night; and was kept awake
      long after he had planned how he would make up to his mother for having
      received her &ldquo;legend&rdquo; so freezingly. What kept him awake,
      after that, was a dim, rhythmic sound coming from the house next door,
      where a holiday dance was in progress&mdash;music far away and slender:
      fiddle, &lsquo;cello, horn, bassoon, drums, all rollicking away almost the
      night-long, seeping through the walls to his restless pillow. Finally,
      when belated drowsiness came, the throbbing tunes mingled with his
      half-dreams, and he heard the light shuffling of multitudinous feet over
      the dancing-floor, and became certain that Laura&rsquo;s were among them.
      He saw her, gliding, swinging, laughing, and happy and the picture did not
      please him: it seemed to him that she would have been much better employed
      sitting in black to write of a hopeless love. Coquetting with four suitors
      was not only inconsistent; it was unbecoming. It &ldquo;suited Cora&rsquo;s
      style,&rdquo; but in Laura it was outrageous. When he woke, in the
      morning, he was dreaming of her: dressed as Parthenia, beautiful, and
      throwing roses to an acclaiming crowd through which she was borne on a
      shield upon the shoulders of four Antinouses. Richard thought it
      scandalous.
    </p>
    <p>
      His indignation with her had not worn off when he descended to breakfast,
      but he made up to his mother for having troubled her. Then, to cap his
      gallantry, he observed that several inches of snow must have fallen during
      the night; it would be well packed upon the streets by noon; he would get
      a sleigh, after lunch, and take her driving. It was a holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked him, but half-declined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s too
      cold for me, but there are lots of nice girls in town, Richard, who won&rsquo;t
      mind weather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I asked <i>you</i>!&rdquo; It was finally left an open question
      for the afternoon to settle; and, upon her urging, he went out for a walk.
      She stood at the window to watch him, and, when she saw that he turned
      northward, she sank into a chair, instead of going to give Joe Varden his
      after-breakfast instructions, and fell into a deep reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outdoors, it was a biting cold morning, wind-swept and gray; and with air
      so frosty-pure no one might breathe it and stay bilious: neither in body
      nor bilious in spirit. It was a wind to sweep the yellow from jaundiced
      cheeks and make them rosy; a wind to clear dulled eyes; it was a wind to
      lift foolish hearts, to lift them so high they might touch heaven and go
      winging down the sky, the wildest of wild-geese.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . When the bell rang, Laura was kneeling before the library fire,
      which she had just kindled, and she had not risen when Sarah brought
      Richard to the doorway. She was shabby enough, poor Cinderella! looking
      up, so frightened, when her prince appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not been to the dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not four suitors. She had none.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came toward her. She rose and stepped back a little. Ashes had blown
      upon her, and, oh, the old, old thought of the woman born to be a mother!
      she was afraid his clothes might get dusty if he came too close.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to Richard she looked very beautiful; and a strange thing happened:
      trembling, he saw that the firelight upon her face was brighter than any
      firelight he had ever seen.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
